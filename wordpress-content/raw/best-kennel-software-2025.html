Today's pet parents expect online booking, instant communication, and transparency about their pets' care. Meanwhile, kennel owners need tools to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage bookings and cancellations without endless phone calls.</li>\n<li>Track vaccinations and medical records to stay compliant.</li>\n<li>Schedule staff shifts and resources efficiently.</li>\n<li>Send automated reminders to reduce no-shows.</li>\n<li>Access reports and analytics for better decision-making.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The right <strong>kennel management software</strong> does all of this — and more — while reducing manual admin so you can focus on pets and clients.</p>\n<h2>What Is Kennel Software?</h2>\n<p>Kennel software is a specialized management tool designed for boarding facilities, daycares, and multi-service pet businesses. Unlike generic booking systems, it includes features tailored to pet care:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Online booking &amp; payments</strong> — accept reservations and deposits 24/7.</li>\n<li><strong>Pet records</strong> — vaccination history, allergies, diet notes.</li>\n<li><strong>Owner portal</strong> — pet parents can update details, upload documents, and see invoices.</li>\n<li><strong>Staff scheduling</strong> — manage ratios, shifts, and workload.</li>\n<li><strong>Reminders</strong> — automated SMS/email to reduce no-shows and keep clients engaged.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-location support</strong> — for businesses operating more than one facility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some solutions also include grooming, training, or retail modules. Others focus purely on boarding and daycare. Choosing the right one depends on your size, budget, and services offered.</p>\n<h2>How We Evaluated the Best Kennel Software</h2>\n<p>To build this guide, we reviewed vendor websites, user reviews on <a href="https://www.capterra.com/kennel-software/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Capterra</a>, and industry benchmarks.

Reviewers on Capterra praise its simplicity and responsive support, though some note limited advanced reporting features. Best suited for straightforward boarding operations.</p>\n<h3>PetExec</h3>\n<p>Feature-rich with modules for POS and retail, PetExec is favored by medium to large facilities. The trade-off is a steeper learning curve and a slightly dated interface. Still, its community and support network are strong.</p>\n<h3>Gingr</h3>\n<p>Known for flexibility, Gingr is widely used across boarding and daycare facilities. It excels in CRM features and multi-location support. Some users mention customer support delays, so plan onboarding carefully.</p>\n<h3>Kennel Booker</h3>\n<p>A UK-based option that's affordable and intuitive. Reviewers highlight its ease of use and solid value, though customization is limited compared to larger platforms.</p>\n<h3>ProPet</h3>\n<p>A Canadian-developed all-in-one system covering boarding, daycare, and grooming. Users appreciate its breadth, though mobile UX could be more polished.</p>\n<h3>PawLoyalty</h3>\n<p>Well-regarded for dog daycare businesses. Staff scheduling and customer engagement tools stand out. However, some advanced features are only available in higher-tier plans.</p>\n<h3>PetLinx</h3>\n<p>A budget-friendly choice offering both cloud and desktop deployments. While the interface feels dated, its flexibility appeals to smaller businesses with tighter budgets.</p>\n<h2>Free &amp; Budget-Friendly Options</h2>\n<p>Some kennel software vendors offer free or freemium plans. While these can help very small facilities get started, they often limit features like online payments or client portals. For growing kennels, investing in a scalable solution like PetCare.Software or ProPet provides long-term ROI.</p>\n<h2>Market Trends for Kennel Software in 2025</h2>\n<p>Several trends are shaping the kennel software market:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI-powered automation</strong> — smarter scheduling and predictive occupancy.</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile-first design</strong> — pet parents expect easy booking on their phones.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration</strong> — syncing with accounting, payment, and CRM tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance</strong> — built-in reminders for vaccinations and licensing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Choose the Best Kennel Software for Your Business</h2>\n<p>When choosing kennel software, consider:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Business size:</strong> Small kennels may need simple booking; larger facilities benefit from multi-location reporting.</li>\n<li><strong>Budget:</strong> Weigh monthly subscription vs. features offered. Free options may save upfront, but lack scalability.</li>\n<li><strong>Services:</strong> Do you offer boarding, daycare, grooming, or training? Pick software that covers your needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Support:</strong> Check vendor support hours, training resources, and community forums.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For most small to medium kennels, <a href="https://petcare.software/kennel-software/">PetCare.Software</a> offers the right balance of features, scalability, and support to grow with your business.</p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Kennel Software</h2>\n\n<h3>What is kennel software and who needs it?</h3>\n<p>Kennel software is a specialized management system designed for pet boarding facilities, kennels, and multi-service pet businesses. It automates booking, scheduling, client communication, and record-keeping. Any business that boards pets overnight—from small kennels with 10 runs to large facilities with multiple locations—benefits from kennel software. It's particularly valuable for businesses that want to offer online booking, track vaccination records, manage staff schedules, and reduce administrative workload.</p>\n\n<h3>How much does kennel software typically cost?</h3>\n<p>Kennel software pricing typically ranges from £29-£69 per month ($35-$85 USD) for basic plans, with more comprehensive solutions starting around $100-$150 per month. Most vendors offer tiered pricing based on the number of users, locations, or pets managed. Some platforms like PetCare.Software offer customized pricing tailored to your specific needs. Factor in setup fees (often $100-$500) and training costs. Most vendors offer free trials lasting 14-30 days, allowing you to test the software risk-free before committing.</p>\n\n<h3>What are the essential features of kennel management software?</h3>\n<p>Essential features include online booking and scheduling, pet profile management with vaccination tracking, automated email and SMS reminders, payment processing with deposits, staff scheduling tools, and a client portal where pet owners can manage bookings and view invoices. Additional valuable features include waitlist management, multi-location support, reporting and analytics, integration with accounting software, and mobile access. The best kennel software combines these features in an intuitive interface that reduces training time and administrative overhead.</p>\n\n<h3>Can kennel software integrate with my existing systems?</h3>\n<p>Most modern kennel software offers integration capabilities with popular business tools. Common integrations include payment processors (Stripe, Square, PayPal), accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero), email marketing platforms (Mailchimp), and calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook). Some platforms like PetCare.Software offer API access for custom integrations. When evaluating software, ask vendors specifically about integrations with tools you currently use, and request documentation or demo of the integration process to ensure it meets your workflow requirements.</p>\n\n<h3>How long does it take to set up kennel software?</h3>\n<p>Setup time varies based on business complexity and data migration needs. Basic setup—creating your account, adding services, and configuring booking rules—typically takes 2-4 hours. Migrating existing client and pet records can add several days, depending on volume and data quality. Most vendors provide onboarding support, training materials, and implementation guides. Plan for 1-2 weeks of parallel operation (running old and new systems simultaneously) to ensure smooth transition. Staff training usually requires 2-3 sessions of 1-2 hours each. Full adoption typically occurs within 30-45 days.</p>\n\n<script type="application/ld+json">\n{\n  "@context": "https://schema.org",\n  "@type": "FAQPage",\n  "mainEntity": [\n    {\n      "@type": "Question",\n      "name": "What is kennel software and who needs it?",\n      "acceptedAnswer": {\n        "@type": "Answer",\n        "text": "Kennel software is a specialized management system designed for pet boarding facilities, kennels, and multi-service pet businesses.
