A written plan with role assignments and checklists reduces confusion and legal risk. Organizations such as the <a href="https://www.avma.org/resources/pet-owners/emergency-care/pet-disaster-preparedness" rel="nofollow noopener">American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)</a> and the <a href="https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/pet-disaster-preparedness.html" rel="nofollow noopener">American Red Cross</a> emphasize preparedness, documentation, and drills as the backbone of animal welfare during crises.</p>\n<h2 id="hazards">Risk Assessment: Know Your Hazards</h2>\n<p>Start with a simple, location-specific risk register. List hazards, likelihood, impact, and mitigation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facility hazards:</strong> Fire, smoke, power loss, HVAC failure, water leaks/floods, chemical spills.</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental hazards:</strong> Severe weather (heat waves, snow/ice, storms), wildfire smoke, flooding.</li>\n<li><strong>Security hazards:</strong> Unauthorized entry, animal escape, civil disruption in the area.</li>\n<li><strong>Animal health hazards:</strong> Infectious disease exposure, aggressive incidents, medication errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Transportation hazards:</strong> Road closures affecting pickups, vendor deliveries, and evacuation routes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Update the register annually and after every incident or near-miss. Use local guidance (e.g., <a href="https://www.ready.gov/" rel="nofollow noopener">FEMA Ready</a> in the US; local authority emergency guidance in the UK) to refine regional risks and alerts.</p>\n<h2 id="plan">Build Your Written Emergency Plan</h2>\n<p>Your plan should be concise, role-based, and easy to access—printed at key stations and stored digitally. Include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Command structure:</strong> Incident Lead, Animal Care Lead, Safety Officer, Comms Lead, and a clear succession if someone is off shift.</li>\n<li><strong>Activation criteria:</strong> When to trigger the plan (alarm, alert, threshold temperature/humidity, smoke index, flood warning).</li>\n<li><strong>Contact lists:</strong> Staff phone/SMS tree, nearby partner vet/24-hour ER, animal control, building management, utilities, preferred transport providers.</li>\n<li><strong>Floor plans:</strong> Exits, fire extinguishers, shut-off valves (gas/water), electrical panels, isolation rooms, assembly points.</li>\n<li><strong>Dog rosters by zone:</strong> Kennel/suite assignments, temperament flags, medication needs, and mobility limitations.</li>\n<li><strong>Checklists by scenario:</strong> Fire, power outage, water leak, severe weather, missing dog, aggressive incident, hazardous chemical exposure.</li>\n<li><strong>Communication templates:</strong> Parent notifications, voicemail changes, website banner text, and social updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Recovery steps:</strong> Damage assessment, sanitation protocol, reopen criteria, documentation and insurance notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="supplies">Emergency Supplies &amp; Facility Hardening</h2>\n<p>Stock supplies for 72 hours of operations without deliveries, assuming full occupancy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Animal care:</strong> Extra food (labeled per dog), water, bowls, leashes, slip leads, muzzles for emergencies, crate labels/ID tags.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical:</strong> First-aid kits, non-latex gloves, eye wash, styptic, bandage materials, digital thermometers, hydrogen peroxide (for wound cleaning per label), emergency contact forms.</li>\n<li><strong>Facility &amp; safety:</strong> Flashlights/headlamps, batteries, portable phone chargers, radios/whistles, tarps, duct tape, absorbents for spills, wet/dry vac.</li>\n<li><strong>Documents:</strong> Printed rosters, vaccination summaries, medication administration records, staff checklists.</li>\n<li><strong>Hardening:</strong> Fire extinguishers (inspected), smoke/CO detectors, surge protection, water leak sensors, backup heat/cooling, non-slip mats by exits, secure fencing and double-gate entries.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="comms">Parent &amp; Stakeholder Communication</h2>\n<p>Clarity calms people. Decide the channel, cadence, and content before you need it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Channels:</strong> SMS for urgent alerts, email for details, phone for sensitive decisions, and a website banner/social post for broad updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Cadence:</strong> Initial alert (within minutes of activation), follow-up within 60 minutes, then periodic status (every 2–4 hours) until resolved.</li>\n<li><strong>Content:</strong> What happened, what you’re doing, dog status, pickup/hold guidance, next update time.</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Save copies of messages in the pet record for accountability and follow-up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="evac-shelter">Evacuation vs. Shelter-in-Place</h2>\n<p>Decide quickly and act decisively. Assign roles for each option.</p>\n<h3>Evacuation (Fire, Gas Leak, Structural Risk)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Trigger alarms; Incident Lead calls emergency services.</li>\n<li>Animal Care Lead moves dogs from nearest exits first; use slip leads and carrier crates for small dogs.</li>\n<li>Bring printed roster and medication bag; close doors to slow smoke spread.</li>\n<li>Assemble at a pre-defined safe area; conduct roll call by kennel list; note missing animals and last-seen location.</li>\n<li>Comms Lead sends status to parents and posts public update if prolonged.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Shelter-in-Place (Severe Weather, External Hazard)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Move dogs to interior rooms away from windows; separate anxious or reactive dogs.</li>\n<li>Fill water containers; secure food and meds; place absorbent pads in case of extended confinement.</li>\n<li>Monitor HVAC and temperature; use crate covers to reduce visual stimuli; white-noise/music to dampen stress.</li>\n<li>Send an “all-safe but sheltering” message with timing for next update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="medical">Medical Incidents &amp; First Aid</h2>\n<p>Define thresholds for onsite first aid vs. immediate veterinary transport. Follow guidance from your partner vet and credible sources such as the Red Cross Pet First Aid program. Key procedures and policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First-aid scope:</strong> Minor cuts/abrasions, nail quick bleeds, heat stress response (cooling protocols), bee stings (monitor swelling/breathing).</li>\n<li><strong>Do-not-administer list:</strong> No human pain meds; no off-label drugs without vet direction; no hydrogen peroxide for inducing vomiting unless explicitly directed by a veterinarian.</li>\n<li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Pre-authorize emergency transport with owners; maintain a go-bag (medical records, owner phone numbers, signed consent).</li>\n<li><strong>Bite/incident protocol:</strong> Separate calmly, assess both dogs, provide first aid, document with photos, notify parents, and log in behavior/incident records.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="software">How Software Supports Emergency Readiness</h2>\n<p>Modern systems such as <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">dog daycare software</a>, <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-boarding-software/">boarding platforms</a>, and <a href="https://petcare.software/kennel-software/">kennel software</a> centralize data and accelerate decision-making when seconds count:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single source of truth:</strong> Instant access to rosters, kennel assignments, diet/meds, emergency contacts, and vaccination records—even from mobile devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Broadcast messaging:</strong> Send templated SMS/email updates by stay, room, or whole facility; log delivery status.</li>\n<li><strong>Task lists &amp; drills:</strong> Schedule quarterly drills, extinguisher checks, HVAC filter swaps, and first-aid kit audits with due dates and proof-of-completion.</li>\n<li><strong>Incident logging:</strong> Attach photos, staff notes, and veterinary receipts; generate post-incident reports for insurers.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-service support:</strong> If you also board cats, align protocols via <a href="https://petcare.software/cattery-software/">cattery software</a> and maintain species-specific sheltering areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="training">Training, Drills &amp; Continuous Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> Every new hire completes emergency orientation: alarms, exits, crate handling, slip leads, incident voice scripts.</li>\n<li><strong>Quarterly drills:</strong> Rotate scenarios (evacuation, shelter-in-place, missing dog, power loss) and record timed results.</li>\n<li><strong>After-action reviews:</strong> Within 48 hours, document what worked, what didn’t, and update SOPs accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Vendor coordination:</strong> Walk your plan with your partner veterinarian, building manager, and alarm vendor annually.</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Store plans, floor maps, and drill results in your software’s knowledge base and print updated copies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="comparison">Comparison Table: Emergency Types &amp; Responses</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Emergency</th>\n<th>Immediate Action</th>\n<th>Primary Goal</th>\n<th>Key Tools</th>\n<th>Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Fire/Smoke</td>\n<td>Evacuate by nearest exits; roll call</td>\n<td>Life safety</td>\n<td>Slip leads, crates, extinguishers</td>\n<td>Close doors behind you; meet at assembly point</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Power Outage/Heat</td>\n<td>Deploy fans/backup; reduce activity</td>\n<td>Temperature control</td>\n<td>Thermometers, backup power, HVAC alerts</td>\n<td>Shelter in interior rooms if extreme heat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Water Leak/Flood</td>\n<td>Shut off source; move dogs elevated</td>\n<td>Prevent injury/contamination</td>\n<td>Wet/dry vac, sandbags, absorbents</td>\n<td>Isolate circuits if safe; sanitize after</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severe Weather</td>\n<td>Shelter-in-place interior rooms</td>\n<td>Debris/glass protection</td>\n<td>Crate covers, radios, first aid</td>\n<td>Stagger potty breaks; reduce stimuli</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing Dog</td>\n<td>Lockdown; last-seen sweep; alert staff</td>\n<td>Containment</td>\n<td>Radios, perimeter checks, GPS if used</td>\n<td>Notify owner once search is underway</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medical Emergency</td>\n<td>First aid; call vet/ER; transport</td>\n<td>Stabilization</td>\n<td>First-aid kit, go-bag, consent forms</td>\n<td>Document timeline and communications</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>\n<h3>How often should we run emergency drills?</h3>\n<p>Quarterly is a solid baseline.
