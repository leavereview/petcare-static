<p>Not all <strong>dog boarding software</strong> is created equal. Some systems handle bookings but skip vaccination compliance. Others offer reports but make it hard for pet parents to self-serve. If you’re a small or medium facility, the right feature set saves hours every week, prevents errors, and lifts revenue. In this guide, we break down the <strong>10 essential features</strong> every modern dog boarding platform should include — plus how to evaluate vendors against this checklist.</p>\n\n<p class="post-updated"><em>Last updated: December 17, 2025</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Use this guide alongside our related resources: <a href="https://petcare.software/kennel-software/">kennel software</a>, <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">dog daycare software</a>, and <a href="https://petcare.software/cattery-software/">cattery software</a>.

Choosing software with the <em>right</em> features means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Less admin:</strong> Automation replaces repetitive tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher satisfaction:</strong> Pet parents get a modern, self-serve experience.</li>\n<li><strong>More revenue:</strong> Upsells and better occupancy management boost income.</li>\n<li><strong>Future-proofing:</strong> If you add daycare or grooming, you won’t need to switch systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The 10 Must-Have Features of Dog Boarding Software</h2>\n<h3>1) 24/7 Online Booking</h3>\n<p>Pet parents should be able to book anytime from desktop or mobile. Look for support for <strong>deposits</strong>, <strong>packages</strong>, and <strong>recurring stays</strong>. Approvals and blackout dates are helpful during peak season.</p>\n<h3>2) Vaccination Tracking with Automated Reminders</h3>\n<p>Compliance is non-negotiable. Your system should allow <strong>uploading certificates</strong>, flag <strong>expiring vaccines</strong>, and send <strong>automatic reminders</strong> to owners ahead of check-in.</p>\n<h3>3) Owner Portal (Self-Service)</h3>\n<p>A secure portal cuts admin by letting clients <strong>update pet details</strong>, <strong>upload proof of vaccination</strong>, <strong>sign waivers</strong>, and <strong>pay invoices</strong> — without calling the desk.</p>\n<h3>4) Run/Room &amp; Capacity Management</h3>\n<p>Capacity-aware calendars prevent double-booking and help you assign runs or suites intelligently. Bonus points for <strong>visual run maps</strong> and <strong>litter-mate linking</strong> for households boarding multiple dogs.</p>\n<h3>5) Automated Email/SMS Reminders</h3>\n<p>Reduce no-shows and last-minute chaos with scheduled reminders for bookings, drop-offs, pickups, and balances due. It’s a win for customer satisfaction and staff sanity.</p>\n<h3>6) Integrated Payments &amp; Invoicing</h3>\n<p>Integrated checkout simplifies deposits, balances, and refunds. Clear, itemized invoices (including upsells) prevent awkward conversations and speed up payment collection.</p>\n<h3>7) Upsell &amp; Add-On Workflows</h3>\n<p>Increase average order value by offering <strong>baths, nail trims, enrichment sessions, daycare, or retail items</strong> during booking or check-in. The best systems make upsells one click.</p>\n<h3>8) Staff Scheduling &amp; Task Lists</h3>\n<p>Even small teams benefit from shift planning and daily task boards (medications, feeding, walks). Look for <strong>role-based permissions</strong> and <strong>activity logs</strong> for accountability.</p>\n<h3>9) Reporting &amp; Analytics</h3>\n<p>You need quick answers: occupancy by date, revenue by service, repeat customer %, and busiest lead sources. Export to CSV and filter by location if you have multiple sites.</p>\n<h3>10) Mobile-Optimized Experience</h3>\n<p>From the owner portal to the staff dashboard, mobile is essential. Managers should be able to approve bookings and check occupancy from a phone — especially on weekends.</p>\n<h2>Feature Comparison: Which Platforms Check Every Box?</h2>\n<p>The table below summarizes how leading products line up against the 10 must-haves. <strong>PetCare.Software</strong> is our all-around pick for small and growing facilities.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Software</th>\n<th>Online Booking</th>\n<th>Vaccine Tracking</th>\n<th>Owner Portal</th>\n<th>Run/Capacity</th>\n<th>Reminders</th>\n<th>Payments</th>\n<th>Upsells</th>\n<th>Staff/Tasks</th>\n<th>Reporting</th>\n<th>Mobile</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>PetCare.Software</strong></td>\n<td>✓ Deposits &amp; packages</td>\n<td>✓ Uploads &amp; auto-expiry</td>\n<td>✓ E-sign &amp; self-serve</td>\n<td>✓ Capacity-aware</td>\n<td>✓ Email &amp; SMS</td>\n<td>✓ Integrated</td>\n<td>✓ Grooming/daycare/retail</td>\n<td>✓ Roles &amp; tasks</td>\n<td>✓ Revenue/occupancy</td>\n<td>✓ Fully responsive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revelation Pets</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ Basic</td>\n<td>✓ Basic</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✗ Limited</td>\n<td>✗</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gingr</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ Advanced</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ Packages/add-ons</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ Advanced</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PetExec</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ POS/retail</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kennel Booker</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ Basic</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ Basic</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✗ Basic</td>\n<td>✗</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ProPet</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ Add-ons</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PetLinx</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ Basic</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓ Basic</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✗ Limited</td>\n<td>✗</td>\n<td>✓ Basic</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><small>Feature claims are based on public information as of September 2025; confirm details on vendor sites.</small></p>\n<h2>How to Evaluate Vendors Against This Checklist</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Map your workflows:</strong> Booking → vaccination → check-in → stay tasks → checkout.
