The right <strong>dog daycare software</strong> turns that chaos into a smooth, repeatable workflow. In this guide, we compare the <em>best dog daycare software for small and medium businesses in 2025</em>, explain which features matter most, and show why many daycares choose <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">PetCare.Software</a> as their all-in-one platform.</p>\n\n<p class="post-updated"><em>Last updated: December 17, 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To build full topical authority and cross-service consistency, explore our related hubs: <a href="https://petcare.software/kennel-software/">kennel software</a>, <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-boarding-software/">dog boarding software</a>, and <a href="https://petcare.software/cattery-software/">cattery software</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Great Daycare Software Should Do (SMB Checklist)</h2>\n<p>Daycare operations are different to boarding: higher repeat frequency, tighter ratio rules, and quick turnarounds. Prioritize software that supports:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>24/7 online booking</strong> for recurring daycare passes and credits</li>\n  <li><strong>Playgroup &amp; capacity management</strong> with staff-to-dog ratios</li>\n  <li><strong>Vaccination tracking</strong> (uploads + automated expiry reminders)</li>\n  <li><strong>Owner portal</strong> for self-service profile updates, e-sign waivers, and payments</li>\n  <li><strong>Packages/punch cards</strong> with auto-decrement and renewal prompts</li>\n  <li><strong>Automated reminders</strong> (email/SMS) for bookings, renewals, and pickups</li>\n  <li><strong>Attendance &amp; check-in tools</strong> for fast mornings</li>\n  <li><strong>Reporting</strong> on utilization, revenue, and repeat customers</li>\n  <li><strong>Mobile-first UX</strong> for staff and pet parents on the go</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Best Dog Daycare Software for Small Businesses (2025)</h2>\n<p>We’ve curated a shortlist that balances ease, features, and value for small to medium daycares. <strong>PetCare.Software</strong> is our recommended all-rounder for growth-focused teams.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Software</th>\n      <th>Starting Price*</th>\n      <th>Free Trial</th>\n      <th>Online Booking</th>\n      <th>Packages/Credits</th>\n      <th>Playgroup &amp; Ratios</th>\n      <th>Vaccines</th>\n      <th>Owner Portal</th>\n      <th>Reminders</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>PetCare.Software</strong></td>\n      <td><em>Tailored to SMBs</em></td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>✓ Deposits &amp; recurring</td>\n      <td>✓ Auto-decrement passes</td>\n      <td>✓ Capacity + ratio rules</td>\n      <td>✓ Uploads + auto-expiry</td>\n      <td>✓ E-sign + payments</td>\n      <td>✓ Email &amp; SMS</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Gingr</td>\n      <td>From $59/mo</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓ Packages</td>\n      <td>✓ Groups</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Revelation Pets</td>\n      <td>From $39/mo</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✗ Limited</td>\n      <td>✗ Basic</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓ Basic</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>ProPet</td>\n      <td>From $50/mo</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>PetExec</td>\n      <td>From $69/mo</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓ Advanced</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p><small>*Pricing snapshots as of September 2025; confirm current rates on vendor sites.</small></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Daycare Needs Different Features Than Boarding</h2>\n<p>Boarding prioritizes runs/suites and overnight stays; daycare is fast-paced and repetitive. The biggest operational differences:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Recurring attendance:</strong> Weekly routines demand packages/credits and bulk scheduling.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ratios over rooms:</strong> Safety depends on staff-to-dog ratios and compatible playgroups.</li>\n  <li><strong>Speed at check-in:</strong> Mornings are intense; scanning, tap-to-check-in, and portal prework are critical.</li>\n  <li><strong>Communication volume:</strong> More frequent reminders, renewals, and behavior notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Software built with daycare in mind reduces friction, protects safety, and keeps utilization high.</p>\n\n<h2>Feature Deep-Dive (What to Look For)</h2>\n\n<h3>1) Packages, Passes &amp; Auto-Decrement</h3>\n<p>Daycare success depends on recurring visits. Your system should sell and track 5-, 10-, or monthly passes; decrement automatically at check-in; and prompt renewal before credits run out.</p>\n\n<h3>2) Playgroup, Capacity &amp; Ratios</h3>\n<p>Define groups (e.g., Puppies, Small, Large, Seniors), set maximums, and enforce staff-to-dog ratios. Bonus points for temperament tags and “only with sibling” pairing.</p>\n\n<h3>3) Vaccination Tracking &amp; Reminders</h3>\n<p>Owners upload certificates; the system warns about expiries well before the next visit — preventing awkward denials at the door.</p>\n\n<h3>4) Owner Portal &amp; Mobile Experience</h3>\n<p>Self-service profile updates, waiver e-sign, package balances, and payment history. Everything should work beautifully on a phone.</p>\n\n<h3>5) Fast Check-In &amp; Attendance</h3>\n<p>Search, scan, tap-to-check-in, and bulk actions for the morning rush. Notes and behavior flags should be visible at a glance.</p>\n\n<h3>6) Reminders &amp; Renewals</h3>\n<p>Automated SMS/email for upcoming bookings, package balances, and renewal prompts. Smart templates save staff time.</p>\n\n<h3>7) Upsells &amp; Add-Ons</h3>\n<p>Offer nail trims, enrichment sessions, or training at checkout or check-in. These small add-ons compound into meaningful revenue.</p>\n\n<h3>8) Reporting That Matters</h3>\n<p>Utilization by group/hour, revenue by product, repeat rate, and top customers. Export to CSV for accounting or marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vendor Snapshots (Short &amp; Honest)</h2>\n\n<h3>PetCare.Software (Recommended)</h3>\n<p><strong>Best for SMBs that need true daycare features without complexity.</strong> Recurring online booking, auto-decrement packages, ratio-aware playgroups, fast check-in, vaccination uploads with automated reminders, owner portal with e-sign and payments, and actionable utilization reports. Clean mobile-first UX your team and clients will actually enjoy.</p>\n<p><a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/" class="cta-button">Book a Demo with PetCare.Software</a></p>\n\n<h3>Gingr</h3>\n<p>Powerful, popular, and flexible. Excellent for larger or multi-location daycares. Smaller teams may find the breadth more than they need at first.</p>\n\n<h3>Revelation Pets</h3>\n<p>Simple, affordable, and easy to learn. Great for basics; packages and ratio tools are lighter than daycare-first platforms.</p>\n\n<h3>ProPet</h3>\n<p>Solid all-in-one covering daycare, boarding, grooming, and retail. Good reporting; UI continues to improve.</p>\n\n<h3>PetExec</h3>\n<p>Feature-rich with POS/retail strengths. Robust daycare capabilities; onboarding may take a little longer for very small teams.</p>\n\n<h2>Pricing &amp; ROI (Daycare Edition)</h2>\n<p>Expect SMB-friendly plans around $39–$69/month. The real ROI drivers:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Time saved:</strong> Faster check-ins, fewer phone calls, automated renewals</li>\n  <li><strong>Higher utilization:</strong> Ratio-aware scheduling keeps groups safely near capacity</li>\n  <li><strong>Recurring revenue:</strong> Packages auto-renew before credits run out</li>\n  <li><strong>Add-on lift:</strong> Enrichment/training upsells increase revenue per visit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Choose (A 5-Step Process)</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Map your day:</strong> From 7:30 a.m. drop-offs to late pickups. Identify bottlenecks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Shortlist 2–3 platforms:</strong> Ensure they support packages, ratios, and rapid check-in.</li>\n  <li><strong>Trial real tasks:</strong> Create a recurring booking, sell a 10-pass, check in 10 dogs, and run a utilization report.</li>\n  <li><strong>Check support:</strong> Response times matter when mornings are hectic.</li>\n  <li><strong>Plan to grow:</strong> Choose software that scales into <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-boarding-software/">boarding</a> or <a href="https://petcare.software/kennel-software/">kennel</a> without switching.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Great <strong>dog daycare software</strong> isn’t just about taking bookings — it’s about running safe, full, repeatable playgroups with minimal admin. Competitors cover parts of the puzzle, but <strong><a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">PetCare.Software</a></strong> stands out for combining recurring online booking, packages, ratio-aware groups, and a lightning-fast check-in workflow in a clean, SMB-friendly interface.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/" class="cta-button">Get Your Free Demo</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>FAQs: Best Dog Daycare Software (2025)</h2>\n\n<h3>What features are unique to daycare vs. boarding?</h3>\n<p>Packages/passes with auto-decrement, playgroup capacity with ratio rules, and lightning-fast check-in are daycare essentials.
