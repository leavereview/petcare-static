Without software, staying organized becomes nearly impossible. Operators often face two major pain points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Time drain:</strong> Manual bookings, phone calls, and paper vaccination records waste hours each week.</li>\n<li><strong>Missed revenue:</strong> Without smart systems, it's easy to miss upselling opportunities like grooming, baths, training add-ons, or retail purchases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the right <strong>dog daycare management software</strong>, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automate online booking, check-ins, and billing.</li>\n<li>Send vaccination reminders automatically.</li>\n<li>Optimize staff scheduling and playgroup ratios.</li>\n<li>Upsell extras at the point of booking or check-in.</li>\n<li>Provide pet parents with a seamless portal for updates and payments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What Is Dog Daycare Software?</h2>\n<p><strong>Dog daycare software</strong> is a specialized management system designed to handle daily daycare operations efficiently. Unlike generic booking tools, it includes features tailored to pet care:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Online booking &amp; payments:</strong> Clients can schedule daycare visits, buy packages, and pay securely.</li>\n<li><strong>Pet profiles:</strong> Store vaccination records, dietary needs, playgroup preferences.</li>\n<li><strong>Owner portal:</strong> Pet parents can update details, sign waivers, and view invoices.</li>\n<li><strong>Staff &amp; playgroup scheduling:</strong> Assign dogs to groups, track ratios, and manage shifts.</li>\n<li><strong>Upsell management:</strong> Add grooming, training, or retail to daycare bookings.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated reminders:</strong> Reduce no-shows and keep clients engaged.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How We Evaluated the Best Dog Daycare Software</h2>\n<p>We analyzed leading platforms using vendor documentation, industry benchmarks, and <a href="https://www.capterra.com/kennel-software/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Capterra reviews</a>.

Online booking with packages, vaccination auto-reminders, and a mobile-friendly portal eliminate admin headaches. The platform also enables <em>upselling at checkout</em> — offering baths, grooming, or retail add-ons during booking. Multi-location support makes it a long-term choice as your daycare grows.</p>\n<p><a class="cta-button" href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">Book a Demo with PetCare.Software</a></p>\n<h3>Gingr</h3>\n<p>A strong choice for large or multi-location daycares. Excellent flexibility, though support response can be slower at peak times.</p>\n<h3>Revelation Pets</h3>\n<p>Simple, affordable, and intuitive. Best for smaller facilities that need core booking and reminders without advanced upselling.</p>\n<h3>PetExec</h3>\n<p>Feature-rich with POS and retail modules. Great for upselling, but training staff may take longer due to a steeper learning curve.</p>\n<h3>PawLoyalty</h3>\n<p>Focused on daycare scheduling and staff management. Strong upsell workflows and good support reputation.</p>\n<h3>ProPet</h3>\n<p>All-in-one platform covering daycare, boarding, and grooming. Highly flexible, but mobile UX could be more polished.</p>\n<h3>Kennel Booker</h3>\n<p>Affordable and easy to use, but upselling tools are limited compared to rivals.</p>\n<h3>PetLinx</h3>\n<p>Budget-friendly, with both desktop and cloud versions. Interface feels dated, but reliable for small daycares.</p>\n<h2>Free &amp; Budget-Friendly Options</h2>\n<p>Some vendors offer free or limited plans. While useful for startups, they often lack upsell workflows and automation. Growing daycares should consider platforms like <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">PetCare.Software</a> that combine efficiency with revenue growth.</p>\n<h2>Trends in Dog Daycare Software (2025)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mobile-first</strong>: Pet parents expect easy booking and updates via phone.</li>\n<li><strong>Upsell automation</strong>: Add-ons integrated into booking flows boost revenue.</li>\n<li><strong>AI scheduling</strong>: Smarter staffing ratios and occupancy predictions.</li>\n<li><strong>Deeper integrations</strong>: Payment, marketing, and accounting syncs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Choose the Best Dog Daycare Software</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Time-saving:</strong> Look for automation of bookings, reminders, and check-ins.</li>\n<li><strong>Revenue growth:</strong> Ensure the platform supports upselling and packages.</li>\n<li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Staff and clients should find it intuitive.</li>\n<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> If you plan to expand, choose a system that handles multi-location.</li>\n<li><strong>Support:</strong> Reliable onboarding and ongoing help are crucial.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For most facilities, <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">PetCare.Software</a> strikes the best balance — saving time and unlocking new revenue streams.</p>\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Dog Daycare Software</h2>\n\n<h3>What features should dog daycare software include?</h3>\n<p>Essential features include online booking with package support, automated vaccination tracking and reminders, staff scheduling with ratio enforcement, client self-service portals, mobile accessibility for both staff and clients, and integrated payment processing. The best systems also offer playgroup management, reporting dashboards, and upsell capabilities for services like grooming or training.</p>\n\n<h3>How does daycare software handle daily attendance tracking?</h3>\n<p>Modern daycare software provides quick check-in/check-out systems that can work via mobile devices, tablets, or desktop computers. Staff can scan QR codes, tap pet profiles, or use bulk check-in features during busy morning drop-offs. The system automatically updates attendance records, tracks which dogs are in which playgroups, monitors staff-to-dog ratios in real-time, and maintains a complete history of visits for billing and reporting purposes.</p>\n\n<h3>Can parents receive updates and photos through the software?</h3>\n<p>Yes, most quality daycare software includes parent portal features where pet parents can log in to see real-time updates, photos, and report cards about their dog's day. Staff can quickly upload photos and add notes about behavior, meals, or activities. Some systems also send automated text or email notifications for check-in, check-out, and special updates, keeping parents connected throughout the day without constant phone calls.</p>\n\n<h3>What's the difference between daycare and boarding software?</h3>\n<p>While both types manage pet care bookings, daycare software focuses on recurring daily visits, playgroup management, quick check-ins, and high-volume daily operations. Boarding software emphasizes overnight stays, run/kennel assignments, feeding schedules, and medication tracking. The best platforms like <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">PetCare.Software</a> combine both capabilities, letting you manage daycare and boarding services in one system without switching between different tools.</p>\n\n<h3>How does online booking work for dog daycares?</h3>\n<p>Online booking allows pet parents to view your daycare's availability in real-time, select dates for drop-off, choose any add-on services like grooming or training, and complete payment — all through a web portal or mobile app. The system automatically checks vaccination requirements, enforces cancellation policies, sends confirmation emails, and updates your schedule. Parents can also purchase daycare packages (like 10-visit passes) or set up recurring reservations for regular weekly visits, reducing administrative work for your staff.</p>\n\n<!-- pcs-context-links -->\n<div class="pcs-context-links">\n<strong>Related reading</strong>\n<ul class="pcs-related-list">\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/how-to-start-a-dog-daycare-business-step-by-step-guide-free-checklist/">How to Start a Dog Daycare Business</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/how-to-choose-the-best-kennel-software/">How to Choose the Best Kennel Software</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/best-dog-boarding-software-in-2025-complete-guide-reviews/">Best Dog Boarding Software in 2025</a></li>\n</ul>\n<em>Explore pillars:</em>\n<ul class="pcs-pillar-list">\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">Dog Daycare Software</a> - Complete features & pricing</li>\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/kennel-software/">Kennel Software</a> - Related management solutions</li>\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/dog-boarding-software/">Dog Boarding Software</a> - Alternative options</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class="pcs-pillar-list">\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">dog daycare software</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/dog-boarding-software/">dog boarding software</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/kennel-software/">kennel software</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://petcare.software/cattery-software/">cattery software</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Conclusion: The Best Dog Daycare Software in 2025</h2>\n<p>The best <strong>dog daycare software</strong> helps you stay organized, save time, and unlock new revenue streams.
