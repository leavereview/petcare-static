<p>Running a cattery comes with unique challenges. Cats require specialized housing, quiet spaces, and detailed care records — from feeding schedules to vaccination status. For small and medium-sized cattery operators, keeping track of all this on paper or spreadsheets is stressful and time-consuming. That's where <strong>cattery software</strong> comes in. The right platform keeps you organized, saves time, and gives pet parents confidence that their cats are in safe hands.</p>\n\n<p class="post-updated"><em>Last updated: December 17, 2025</em></p>\n\n\n<p>In this guide, we'll compare the <em>best cattery software in 2025</em>, highlight key features, and explain why many independent operators are switching to <a href="https://petcare.software/cattery-software/">PetCare.Software</a> — an all-in-one solution built for kennels, daycares, boarding facilities, and catteries.</p>\n<h2>Why Cattery Software Matters for Small &amp; Medium Operators</h2>\n<p>Unlike dogs, cats require a different style of boarding. They need quiet, stress-free environments, careful handling, and often individual feeding or medication. For cattery owners, the biggest challenges are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Organization:</strong> Managing bookings, feeding schedules, and health notes manually is prone to errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Vaccination and licensing rules vary by region and must be tracked accurately.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer confidence:</strong> Pet parents want transparency and updates about their cats' care.</li>\n<li><strong>Time management:</strong> Too much time spent on admin means less focus on care and growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good <strong>cattery management software</strong> solves these pain points by automating bookings, reminders, feeding logs, and communications — making life easier for both operators and cat owners.</p>\n<h2>What Is Cattery Software?</h2>\n<p><strong>Cattery software</strong> is a specialized tool for managing cat boarding facilities. It's similar to kennel or <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-boarding-software/">dog boarding software</a>, but includes cat-specific management tools. Key features usually include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Online booking &amp; payments:</strong> Pet parents can reserve a cattery suite and pay online.</li>\n<li><strong>Pet records:</strong> Vaccination history, diet notes, medication reminders, behavior preferences.</li>\n<li><strong>Owner portal:</strong> Clients update records, upload vaccine certificates, view invoices.</li>\n<li><strong>Feeding &amp; medication schedules:</strong> Track special diets or prescriptions.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated reminders:</strong> Notify owners about upcoming bookings or vaccinations.</li>\n<li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Monitor occupancy, revenue, and trends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some platforms support multi-service facilities (boarding dogs and cats), while others are streamlined for catteries only.</p>\n<h2>How We Evaluated the Best Cattery Software</h2>\n<p>We reviewed top vendors using vendor documentation, industry benchmarks, and user reviews from <a href="https://www.capterra.com/kennel-software/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Capterra</a>.

While <a href="https://petcare.software/kennel-software/">kennel software</a> focuses on dogs, cattery software adds cat-specific features like feeding and medication logs for feline care.</p>\n<h3>Can I use one system for both cats and dogs?</h3>\n<p>Yes. All-in-one platforms like <a href="https://petcare.software/cattery-software/">PetCare.Software</a> manage cats, dogs, and other services in one dashboard.</p>\n<h3>How does cattery software save time?</h3>\n<p>It automates bookings, vaccination tracking, feeding logs, and reminders — reducing manual admin hours each week.</p>\n<h3>Does it help with compliance?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Many platforms send automatic vaccination reminders, helping you stay compliant with local licensing laws.</p>\n<h3>Is cattery software affordable for small businesses?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Plans start as low as $29–$39/month with trials available. Scalable platforms like PetCare.Software offer tailored pricing for small operators.</p>\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Cattery Software</h2>\n\n<h3>What is cattery software and how is it different from kennel software?</h3>\n<p>Cattery software is specifically designed for cat boarding facilities with features tailored to feline care, including FIV/FeLV testing tracking, individual housing preferences, feeding schedules for finicky eaters, and stress monitoring. While kennel software focuses on dogs with group play and exercise tracking, cattery software emphasizes quiet environments, litter box monitoring, and cat-specific health protocols that differ from canine care requirements.</p>\n\n<h3>What cat-specific features should cattery software have?</h3>\n<p>Essential cat-specific features include individual housing assignment (cats rarely share spaces), FIV/FeLV test result tracking, detailed feeding schedules for special diets, medication reminders for chronic conditions common in cats, litter box monitoring logs, stress level observations, and the ability to track whether cats are indoor-only (affecting outdoor enclosure usage). The software should also manage quiet time requirements and minimal handling preferences for anxious cats.</p>\n\n<h3>How does cattery software track FIV/FeLV testing records?</h3>\n<p>Cattery software stores digital copies of FIV/FeLV test results on each cat's profile, tracks test dates and expiration periods, and sends automatic alerts when tests are approaching expiration (typically annually). The system can flag cats without current test results during booking, prevent check-ins for non-compliant cats, and generate reports showing which cats need updated testing before their next stay.</p>\n\n<h3>Can cattery software manage dietary requirements for cats?</h3>\n<p>Yes, cattery software manages complex feline dietary needs including prescription diets for urinary, kidney, or digestive issues, feeding schedules (many cats need multiple small meals), food allergies and preferences, wet versus dry food specifications, and portion sizes by weight. Staff receive feeding reminders with specific instructions for each cat, and the system tracks which cats require separated feeding times to prevent food aggression.</p>\n\n<h3>How much does cattery management software cost?</h3>\n<p>Cattery software typically costs $40-150 per month depending on features and facility size. Entry-level plans ($40-60/month) cover basic booking and records, mid-tier plans ($70-100/month) add automated reminders and owner portals, while premium plans ($100-150/month) include advanced reporting, multi-location support, and integrated payment processing. Many providers offer free trials to test cat-specific features before committing.</p>\n\n<script type="application/ld+json">\n{\n  "@context": "https://schema.org",\n  "@type": "FAQPage",\n  "mainEntity": [\n    {\n      "@type": "Question",\n      "name": "What is cattery software and how is it different from kennel software?",\n      "acceptedAnswer": {\n        "@type": "Answer",\n        "text": "Cattery software is specifically designed for cat boarding facilities with features tailored to feline care, including FIV/FeLV testing tracking, individual housing preferences, feeding schedules for finicky eaters, and stress monitoring.
