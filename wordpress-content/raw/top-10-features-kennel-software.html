Some platforms offer only the basics, while others come packed with advanced features that save time, improve compliance, and increase customer satisfaction. For small and medium kennel operators, choosing the right feature set can make the difference between running smoothly and struggling with endless admin.</p>\n\n<p class="post-updated"><em>Last updated: December 17, 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this guide, we’ll walk through the <strong>10 must-have features in a kennel management system</strong>. Whether you’re upgrading from spreadsheets or switching from an outdated platform, this checklist will help you evaluate options. We’ll also show how <a href="https://petcare.software/kennel-software/">PetCare.Software</a> brings all of these features together in one intuitive solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Features Matter for Small Kennels</h2>\n\n<p>When running a small kennel, your time and resources are limited. Every feature should solve a real-world problem, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Reducing admin hours</li>\n  <li>Keeping vaccination records compliant</li>\n  <li>Giving pet parents a smoother experience</li>\n  <li>Helping you scale without extra staff</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Software that lacks essential features may seem cheaper upfront, but often costs more in wasted time and missed opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2>10 Must-Have Features of a Kennel Management System</h2>\n\n<h3>1. Online Booking</h3>\n<p>Pet parents expect to book online 24/7, not just during business hours. The system should allow secure reservations, deposits, and package purchases.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Vaccination Tracking</h3>\n<p>Vaccination compliance is critical. Look for automated reminders and easy uploads of certificates to avoid manual chasing.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Owner Portal</h3>\n<p>A self-service portal reduces phone calls and admin. Owners can update records, upload documents, and pay invoices online.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Automated Reminders</h3>\n<p>Email or SMS reminders for bookings, check-ins, and payments cut no-shows and improve customer satisfaction.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Pet Profiles</h3>\n<p>Detailed pet records should include health history, feeding schedules, medication, and behavior notes for safer care.</p>\n\n<h3>6. Staff Scheduling</h3>\n<p>Even in small kennels, staff schedules matter. Built-in scheduling tools ensure coverage and help balance workloads.</p>\n\n<h3>7. Reporting &amp; Analytics</h3>\n<p>Basic reports on occupancy, revenue, and trends help you make better decisions and plan growth.</p>\n\n<h3>8. Payment Integration</h3>\n<p>Integrated billing and payments streamline the process for both owners and staff. No more chasing invoices.</p>\n\n<h3>9. Mobile Access</h3>\n<p>Cloud-based, mobile-friendly access means you can manage bookings from anywhere, anytime.</p>\n\n<h3>10. Scalability</h3>\n<p>Choose software that grows with you. Whether you expand into <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-boarding-software/">boarding</a>, <a href="https://petcare.software/dog-daycare-software/">daycare</a>, or <a href="https://petcare.software/cattery-software/">catteries</a>, your system should handle it without disruption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Feature Comparison: Kennel Software Options</h2>\n\n<p>Here’s a comparison of leading platforms and whether they include the top 10 features. <strong>PetCare.Software</strong> checks every box.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Software</th>\n      <th>Online Booking</th>\n      <th>Vaccination Tracking</th>\n      <th>Owner Portal</th>\n      <th>Reminders</th>\n      <th>Pet Profiles</th>\n      <th>Staff Scheduling</th>\n      <th>Reporting</th>\n      <th>Payments</th>\n      <th>Mobile Access</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>PetCare.Software</strong></td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Revelation Pets</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓ Basic</td>\n      <td>✗</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Gingr</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓ Advanced</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Kennel Booker</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓ Basic</td>\n      <td>✗</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>ProPet</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n      <td>✓</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Why PetCare.Software Covers All 10 Features</h2>\n\n<p>While many vendors cover some of the essentials, few deliver the full package. <strong>PetCare.Software</strong> includes all 10 must-have features, specifically designed for small and medium kennel operators.
