Running a kennel involves coordinating bookings, managing facility capacity, tracking animal health, scheduling staff, and communicating with pet parents—all while ensuring every dog receives proper care. Kennel management software brings order to this complexity.

This guide covers everything kennel operators need to know: essential features, platform comparisons, realistic pricing, and how to evaluate options based on your facility's specific needs.

## What Is Kennel Software?

Kennel software is a management platform designed for pet boarding facilities. It handles the full operational cycle:

- **Reservation management** for boarding stays
- **Run and space allocation** optimising facility utilisation
- **Pet health tracking** including vaccinations and medications
- **Client communication** throughout the boarding experience
- **Staff coordination** and task management
- **Financial operations** from deposits to final billing

The goal is centralising everything in one system, eliminating manual tracking, reducing errors, and giving you visibility into your operation.

## Why Kennels Need Management Software

### The Manual Management Problem

Without software, kennel operators typically rely on:

- Paper calendars or whiteboards for bookings
- Handwritten notes for feeding and medication
- Spreadsheets for client records
- Memory and verbal handovers between staff
- Phone calls for all client communication
- Manual invoicing after each stay

This approach creates predictable problems: double bookings during busy periods, missed medications, incomplete handovers, frustrated clients unable to reach you, and no data for business planning.

### What Software Changes

| Without Software | With Kennel Software |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Booking by phone during business hours | 24/7 online booking |
| Paper vaccination records | Digital tracking with expiry alerts |
| Verbal staff handovers | Documented care instructions |
| No visibility into upcoming capacity | Forecasting and waitlists |
| Post-stay invoicing and chasing payment | Automatic billing with deposits |
| Guessing at business performance | Real-time dashboards and reports |

### Platform Analysis

**Gingr** is well-suited for medium to large kennels. Strong multi-location support, comprehensive features, and good integrations. The learning curve is steeper than simpler platforms, but capabilities justify this for growing operations.

**PetExec** offers deep functionality with modules for retail, grooming, and training alongside core kennel features. Interface is dated but reliable. Strong user community and documentation.

**Revelation Pets** provides accessible entry-level pricing with solid core features. Ideal for smaller kennels wanting simplicity over advanced capabilities. Support is responsive.

**ProPet** balances features and pricing effectively. Good for kennels offering multiple services. Canadian-developed but works internationally.

**Kennel Booker** offers excellent value for UK and European kennels. Clean, intuitive interface. Less customisation than larger platforms but covers essentials well.

**PetLinx** is the budget option for very small kennels. Both cloud and desktop versions available. Interface is dated but functional.

**Kennel Connection** is an established player with traditional kennel focus. Desktop-oriented with comprehensive features. Better for larger traditional operations than modern startups.

## Pricing Guide

### Typical Cost Ranges

**Small Kennels (Under 20 runs)**
- Monthly cost: $30-60
- Setup: Usually minimal or included
- Best platforms: Revelation Pets, Kennel Booker, PetLinx

**Medium Kennels (20-50 runs)**
- Monthly cost: $60-130
- Setup: $0-300
- Best platforms: ProPet, PetExec, Gingr

**Large Kennels (50+ runs)**
- Monthly cost: $130-250+
- Setup: Varies, may include migration
- Best platforms: Gingr, PetExec, PetCare.Software

### What Affects Pricing

- **Number of users/staff logins**: Some platforms charge per user
- **Feature tier**: Advanced reporting, integrations cost more
- **Payment processing**: Typically 2.5-3% per transaction
- **SMS messaging**: Often metered or capped
- **Multi-location**: Usually requires higher tiers
- **Custom development**: Enterprise only

### Calculating ROI

For a kennel with 30 runs averaging $45/night at 70% occupancy:

**Monthly revenue**: 30 x 0.7 x 30 days x $45 = $28,350

**Software impact**:
- 5% occupancy improvement: +$2,025/month
- 10 hours/week admin savings: +$800/month
- 3% reduction in no-shows: +$850/month
- Total benefit: ~$3,675/month

**Software cost**: ~$100/month

**Net benefit**: ~$3,575/month

Even conservative assumptions show significant ROI.

## Kennel Software vs. Spreadsheets

### When Spreadsheets Work

Honestly, spreadsheets can handle:
- Very small operations (under 10 runs)
- Single-service facilities (boarding only)
- Owner-operated with no staff
- Predictable, low-volume booking patterns

### When to Switch to Software

Signs you've outgrown spreadsheets:
- Booking errors increasing
- Staff can't find information quickly
- Clients complain about communication
- You can't easily see upcoming capacity
- Medication or feeding mistakes occur
- Running multiple spreadsheets to track everything
- Spending hours on end-of-month invoicing

The typical breaking point is around 15-20 runs or hiring your first non-family employee.

## Kennel Software vs. Dog Boarding Software

This question comes up frequently. The short answer: they're largely the same thing.

"Kennel software" traditionally referred to facilities calling themselves kennels—often outdoor or semi-outdoor runs, sometimes associated with breeding operations.

"Dog boarding software" is the more modern term, often used by facilities positioning themselves as premium or boutique.

Feature-wise, there's no meaningful difference. Any platform marketing either term handles overnight dog stays. Choose based on features, pricing, and fit—not the label.

## Implementation Guide

### Pre-Implementation

1. **Audit current processes**: Document how you do things now
2. **Clean your data**: Update client contacts, verify vaccination dates
3. **Define your requirements**: Must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
4. **Set realistic timeline**: 2-4 weeks for most kennels
5. **Prepare your team**: Explain the change and address concerns

### Data Migration

If moving from another system or spreadsheets:

- Export all client and pet records
- Map fields to new system
- Test import with sample data
- Verify critical information manually
- Keep old system accessible during transition

### Staff Training

Training should cover:

- Daily operations (check-in, check-out)
- Booking management
- Care logging (feeding, medications)
- Client communication
- Troubleshooting common issues

Allow 1-2 hours for initial training, plus ongoing support as questions arise.

### Go-Live Timing

**Good times**: Slow season, after a busy period
**Bad times**: Holiday weeks, peak summer, when you're already stretched

Consider parallel running (old and new systems) for 1-2 weeks if your operation is larger.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is kennel software used for?

Kennel software manages all aspects of pet boarding operations: online reservations, run assignment, vaccination tracking, feeding and medication schedules, client communication, and billing. It replaces manual systems with centralised, automated processes.

### How much does kennel software cost per month?

Pricing ranges from $30-60/month for small kennels to $100-250+/month for large facilities. Most platforms offer tiered pricing based on features and facility size. Free trials let you test before committing.

### What are the essential features of kennel management software?

Essentials: online booking with availability display, vaccination tracking with expiry alerts, run/kennel assignment, feeding schedule management, automated client communication, and payment processing. Advanced features include reporting, staff scheduling, and integrations.

### Is kennel software worth it for small businesses?

Yes. Even small kennels (10-15 runs) benefit from automated booking, vaccination compliance, and professional client communication. The time saved on administration typically exceeds the monthly cost within weeks.

### How long does it take to set up kennel software?

Small kennels: 1-2 weeks including data entry and basic training. Medium kennels: 2-3 weeks with more extensive data migration. Large operations: 3-6 weeks with thorough staff training and parallel running.

### Can kennel software handle multiple locations?

Yes, though usually at higher pricing tiers. Multi-location features include centralised booking, location-specific capacity, consolidated reporting, and staff access controls. Check this specifically if you operate multiple sites.

### What's the difference between cloud and desktop kennel software?

Cloud software runs via web browser, accessible anywhere, automatically updated, requiring no local installation. Desktop software installs on your computers, may work offline, but requires manual updates and local backups. Cloud is the modern standard and generally recommended.

### Can clients book kennels online themselves?

Yes, with virtually all modern platforms. Clients see availability, select dates and run type, enter pet information, and pay deposits—all without staff involvement. This significantly reduces phone time and administrative burden.

## Choosing Your Platform

### Decision Framework

1. **Size fit**: Is the platform designed for kennels your size?
2. **Feature match**: Does it handle your specific services?
3. **Budget alignment**: Can you afford it sustainably?
4. **Usability**: Will your team actually use it?
5. **Growth support**: Can it scale with your plans?

### Evaluation Checklist

### Final Advice

Don't overthink this. The best kennel software is the one you'll actually use consistently. Choose a reputable platform that fits your size and budget, commit to proper implementation, and you'll wonder why you waited so long to make the switch.
