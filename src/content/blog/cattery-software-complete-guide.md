Managing a cattery presents unique challenges. Cats need individual housing, careful health monitoring, and specific care protocols that differ from dog boarding. The right cattery software accounts for these feline-specific requirements while handling the standard business operations.

This guide covers cattery management software comprehensively: what makes cat boarding different, essential features, platform options, and how to choose the right solution for your facility.

## What Is Cattery Software?

Cattery software is management software designed for cat boarding facilities. While it shares core functionality with general kennel software, it includes features specific to feline care:

- **Individual unit management** (cats typically don't share spaces)
- **FIV/FeLV testing records** alongside standard vaccinations
- **Detailed feeding management** for finicky eaters
- **Stress monitoring** and quiet environment protocols
- **Litter box tracking** and health indicators
- **Indoor/outdoor preferences** and handling notes

The platform manages reservations, client records, care documentation, and billing—all tailored to how catteries actually operate.

## Why Cat Boarding Differs from Dog Boarding

### Feline-Specific Considerations

Cat boarding has distinct requirements:

**Housing**: Cats rarely share spaces (unlike dog playgroups). Each cat needs their own unit, making capacity management straightforward but different from kennels with shared spaces.

**Health screening**: FIV/FeLV testing is standard for catteries but not required at dog facilities. Vaccination requirements also differ (FVRCP vs. DHPP).

**Feeding complexity**: Cats are notoriously particular. Detailed feeding notes, food brands, and portion sizes matter more than with most dogs.

**Stress management**: Cats stress more visibly in unfamiliar environments. Good catteries monitor stress indicators and provide quiet, secure environments.

**Handling requirements**: Some cats tolerate handling poorly. Documentation of handling preferences prevents incidents.

### What General Software Misses

Generic pet software often falls short for catteries:

- Limited health record customisation for cat-specific requirements
- No FIV/FeLV tracking fields
- Inadequate feeding detail options
- Missing litter box monitoring
- Dog-focused terminology and workflows

Purpose-built cattery software (or well-customised general platforms) addresses these gaps.

## Essential Features for Cattery Software

### Reservation Management

Standard but essential:

- **Online booking** with real-time availability
- **Unit assignment** based on size and type
- **Multi-day stays** with flexible check-in/out
- **Waitlist** for peak periods
- **Recurring reservations** for regular boarders
- **Family bookings** (cats from same household sharing)

### Cat Health Records

Feline-specific health tracking:

- **FIV/FeLV test results** with test dates and expiry
- **FVRCP vaccination** (core cat vaccine) tracking
- **Rabies vaccination** records
- **Flea/parasite treatment** history
- **Medical conditions** (diabetes, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism—common in cats)
- **Medication management** with detailed administration logs

### Feeding Management

Critical for cats:

- **Food type and brand** (cats often reject unfamiliar food)

## Cattery Software Options (2026)

Most platforms marketed for kennels or boarding also work for catteries. Here's how they compare for cat-specific use:

| Software | Starting Price | Cat-Specific Fields | FIV/FeLV Tracking | Feeding Detail | Best For |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------|
| **PetCare.Software** | Custom | Customisable | Yes | Detailed | Multi-service |
| **Revelation Pets** | From $39/mo | Good | Customisable | Good | Small catteries |
| **ProPet** | From $50/mo | Good | Customisable | Good | Mixed facilities |
| **Gingr** | From $99/mo | Customisable | Customisable | Detailed | Larger catteries |
| **Kennel Booker** | From GBP 35/mo | Basic | Custom fields | Basic | UK catteries |
| **PetExec** | From $69/mo | Customisable | Custom fields | Good | Established operations |

*Pricing verified January 2026. Confirm current rates with vendors.*

### Platform Notes for Catteries

**Revelation Pets** works well for smaller catteries. The interface is straightforward, and it handles cat-specific fields adequately. Pricing is accessible for modest operations.

**ProPet** handles cats well, especially for facilities offering both cat and dog boarding. Custom fields accommodate FIV/FeLV tracking.

**Gingr** is more platform than you need for a small cattery, but works excellently for larger or multi-service facilities. Customisation handles all feline requirements.

**Kennel Booker** is popular with UK catteries. Good value, though cat-specific features require some custom configuration.

**PetExec** is customisable enough for catteries but designed primarily for dog facilities. Works fine with proper setup but may feel dog-centric.

### The Customisation Question

No software is built exclusively for catteries. The market is smaller than dog boarding, so vendors build general platforms with customisation options.

**What this means for you**:
- Check that custom fields are available for FIV/FeLV, feeding details, etc.
- Ask vendors about other cattery clients
- Plan to configure the system for your cat-specific needs during setup

## Pricing for Cattery Software

### Cost Expectations

Cattery software costs the same as general boarding software—there's no cat premium:

**Small Catteries (Under 20 units)**
- Budget: $30-60/month
- Platforms: Revelation Pets, Kennel Booker

**Medium Catteries (20-40 units)**
- Budget: $50-100/month
- Platforms: ProPet, PetExec

**Large Catteries (40+ units or multi-service)**
- Budget: $100-200/month
- Platforms: Gingr, PetCare.Software

### ROI for Catteries

For a cattery with 25 units at $25/night average:

**Time savings**
- 6 hours/week admin reduction = $480/month

**No-show reduction**
- 3% improvement = $560/month

**Occupancy improvement**
- 5% better fill rate = $940/month

**Total benefit**: ~$2,000/month vs. ~$60 software cost

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is cattery software and is it different from kennel software?

Cattery software is management software for cat boarding facilities. It's similar to kennel software but should include cat-specific features: FIV/FeLV tracking, detailed feeding management, and individual housing rather than group spaces. Most platforms work for both cats and dogs with proper configuration.

### What cat-specific features should cattery software have?

Essential cat-specific features: FIV/FeLV test result tracking with expiry alerts, FVRCP and rabies vaccination records, detailed feeding fields (food type/brand, portion size, wet/dry preference), medication management for common feline conditions, and stress monitoring capabilities.

### How does cattery software track FIV/FeLV testing?

Good platforms store test dates, results (positive/negative), and expiry periods for both FIV and FeLV tests. The system alerts when tests are approaching expiry and can flag cats without current results during booking. Some platforms require custom field configuration for this.

### Can cattery software manage dietary requirements?

Yes. Look for feeding modules that include food brand/type, wet vs. dry preferences, portion sizes, meal frequency, special diets, and completion tracking. Cats are particular about food, so detailed notes are essential.

### How much does cattery management software cost?

Monthly costs range from $30-60 for small catteries to $100-200+ for larger operations. This is comparable to dog boarding software—there's no premium for cat-specific features. Most platforms offer free trials.

### Do I need separate software if I board cats and dogs?

No. Modern platforms handle multiple species with unified client records. Use separate boarding areas operationally, but manage everything in one system for administrative efficiency.

### Can cat owners book online themselves?

Yes. Online booking is standard across all modern platforms. Clients see unit availability, select dates, enter cat information, and pay deposits without staff involvement.

### What about webcams for cattery clients?

Some platforms integrate with webcam systems for owner viewing. This is less common in catteries than dog facilities (cats are less active to watch), but available if desired. Check webcam integration options with specific platforms.

## Choosing Your Cattery Platform

### Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Custom fields available for FIV/FeLV tracking?
- [ ] Feeding detail level sufficient for finicky cats?
- [ ] Vaccination tracking supports feline vaccines?
- [ ] Other cattery customers use this platform?
- [ ] Pricing appropriate for your size?
- [ ] Free trial available for proper testing?
- [ ] Data export possible if you switch later?

### Decision Factors

1. **Customisation**: Can you configure cat-specific fields?
2. **Size fit**: Is it appropriate for your facility size?
3. **Budget**: Sustainable monthly cost?
4. **Usability**: Will you and staff actually use it?
5. **Support**: Responsive when you have questions?

### Final Recommendation

For small catteries, Revelation Pets or Kennel Booker offer good value with sufficient customisation. Medium and larger catteries should look at ProPet or Gingr for more comprehensive features.

The key is configuring the platform properly for cat-specific needs during setup. No platform is perfect out of the box for catteries, but all can be made to work effectively with thoughtful configuration.
