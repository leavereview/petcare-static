Running a small boarding facility means watching every pound. Software subscriptions add up, so it's worth asking: will boarding software actually pay for itself? Here's an honest assessment.

## The Real Costs

### Monthly Subscription

For small boarding facilities (under 30 runs), expect:

- **Basic plans:** £35-70/month
- **Full-featured plans:** £70-120/month
- **Payment processing:** 2.5-3% per transaction (on top of subscription)

### Setup Investment

- **Time to configure:** 4-10 hours
- **Data migration:** 2-6 hours (if moving from another system)
- **Staff training:** 1-2 hours per person
- **Learning curve:** 2-4 weeks to fluency

### Hidden Costs to Consider

- SMS messaging may have per-message fees
- Premium features (report cards, integrations) may cost extra
- Annual price increases (check contract terms)

## The Real Benefits

### Time Savings

Manual boarding operations consume enormous time:

| Task | Manual Time | With Software |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Taking a booking | 10-15 mins | 0 (self-service) |
| Confirming vaccination status | 5-10 mins | Instant (auto-check) |
| Sending reminders | 5 mins each | Automated |
| Creating invoices | 10-15 mins | Automatic |
| End-of-day paperwork | 30-45 mins | 5-10 mins |

**Conservative estimate:** 8-12 hours saved per week for a 20-run facility.

### Revenue Protection

**No-show reduction:** Automated reminders and deposit requirements typically reduce no-shows by 40-60%.

For a facility with 2 no-shows per week at £45/night average:
- Weekly recovery: £45-55
- Monthly: £180-220

**Booking capture:** Online booking means you never miss enquiries that come after hours. Even capturing 2-3 extra bookings per month adds significant revenue.

### Error Reduction

Software prevents:
- Double bookings (common during busy periods)
- Missed vaccinations (liability risk)
- Feeding/medication errors (documented instructions)
- Lost booking information

One serious error—a dog bite due to missed vaccination, a double-booking refund, or a medication mistake—can cost more than a year of software fees.

### Professional Client Experience

Modern pet parents expect:
- Online booking availability
- Digital confirmations
- Updates during their pet's stay
- Easy payment options

Facilities without these features lose bookings to competitors who offer them.

## ROI Calculation

**Scenario:** 25-run facility, £50/night average, 65% occupancy

| Factor | Monthly Value |
|--------|--------------|
| Admin time savings (10 hrs/week × £15) | +£600 |
| No-show reduction (6 nights × £50 × 50%) | +£150 |
| Additional bookings (online convenience) | +£300 |
| Error prevention (avoided refunds/issues) | +£100 |
| **Total monthly benefit** | **+£1,150** |
| Software cost | -£80 |
| **Net monthly gain** | **+£1,070** |

The software pays for itself many times over.

## When Boarding Software IS Worth It

**Clear yes:**
- You're taking more than 10 bookings per week
- You have (or plan to have) staff handling bookings
- Clients ask about online booking
- You're spending hours on admin tasks
- You've had booking errors or missed vaccinations
- You want to grow beyond your current size

**Probably yes:**
- You're a solo operator with 15+ runs
- You offer multiple services (boarding + daycare + grooming)
- You're competing with facilities that have modern systems

## When It Might Not Be Worth It

**Possible no:**
- You have fewer than 10 runs and no growth plans
- You board only friends/family pets informally
- You genuinely prefer paper systems and have time capacity
- Your client base actively resists technology

These situations are increasingly rare in the commercial boarding market.

## What to Look for in Boarding Software

### Essential Features

- Multi-day reservation management
- Run/kennel assignment and availability display
- Vaccination tracking with expiry alerts
- Feeding and medication logging
- Online booking for clients
- Automated reminders
- Invoicing and payment processing

### Important for Small Facilities

- Simple, intuitive interface
- Quick setup without technical expertise
- Responsive customer support
- Month-to-month contracts (no long lock-ins)
- Affordable entry-level pricing
- Mobile access for on-the-go management

### Red Flags

- No free trial
- Long mandatory contracts
- Complex setup requiring consultants
- No data export option
- Poor or slow customer support

## Making the Decision

### Step 1: Calculate Your Current Admin Time

Track for one week:
- Time on phone/email for bookings
- Time checking vaccination records
- Time creating invoices
- Time on reminders and confirmations

Multiply by your hourly value. This is your potential savings.

### Step 2: Identify Your Pain Points

What causes the most frustration?
- Missed bookings?
- Double bookings?
- Vaccination tracking?
- Client communication?
- Invoicing and payments?

Ensure the software addresses your specific issues.

### Step 3: Trial Properly

During your free trial:
- Enter real client data
- Process real bookings
- Have staff test the system
- Test the client booking experience yourself
- Contact support with questions

### Step 4: Calculate Break-Even

At what point does the software pay for itself?

If software costs £80/month and saves 8 hours of admin time worth £15/hour:
- Monthly savings: £120
- Break-even: Immediate (£40 net gain from day one)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long before I see ROI?

Most facilities see positive ROI within the first month. Full benefits (client adoption of online booking, staff efficiency) typically emerge within 2-3 months.

### What if my clients won't use online booking?

They will. Industry data shows 60-80% adoption within 3 months once available. Keep phone booking as an option for the remainder.

### Can I switch software later?

Yes, but it's disruptive. Choose carefully upfront. Ensure any platform allows data export.

### Do I need training for my staff?

Basic training (1-2 hours) is sufficient for most platforms. Good software is intuitive—if it requires extensive training, it may not be the right choice.

### What about internet reliability?

Cloud software requires internet. If your area has unreliable connectivity, choose a platform with good mobile apps (which can cache data) or consider this risk in your decision.

## Conclusion

For nearly all commercial boarding facilities, software is worth it—and then some. The combination of time savings, error prevention, and professional client experience delivers ROI well beyond the subscription cost.

The operators who question whether software is "worth it" often underestimate how much time they spend on admin, or don't account for the bookings they're losing to competitors with better systems.

Take a free trial. Use it properly for 2-3 weeks with real data. The answer will become obvious.
