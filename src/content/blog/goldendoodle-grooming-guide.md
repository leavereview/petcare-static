Goldendoodles have become one of the most popular breeds in grooming salons. Their friendly temperament and reputation as "hypoallergenic" (more on that later) make them a family favourite—but their diverse coats can challenge even experienced groomers.

This guide covers everything you need to know about goldendoodle grooming, from understanding their varied coat types to executing popular cuts. Whether you're offering [pet grooming services](/pet-grooming-software/) or advising clients on maintenance, this is your comprehensive resource.

## Understanding the Goldendoodle Coat

### The Genetics Factor

Goldendoodles are a cross between Golden Retrievers and Poodles. This means their coats can vary dramatically based on which parent's genes are dominant.

**F1 Goldendoodles** (50% Golden Retriever, 50% Poodle)
- Most variation in coat types
- Can range from straight to curly
- Often have wavy, "shaggy" coats
- May shed moderately

**F1B Goldendoodles** (75% Poodle, 25% Golden Retriever)
- More likely to have curly coats
- Generally lower shedding
- Closer to poodle texture
- More predictable grooming needs

**F2 and Multi-Gen**
- Highly variable
- Each dog must be assessed individually
- Can be any coat type

### Three Coat Types

#### 1. Curly Coat
Most similar to a poodle. Tight curls that don't shed but mat easily without regular maintenance.

**Grooming characteristics:**
- Requires frequent brushing (daily to every other day)
- Mats form quickly, especially in friction areas
- Fluff drying essential for scissor work
- Can handle all poodle-style clips

#### 2. Wavy Coat (Most Common)
The classic "teddy bear" goldendoodle look. Loose waves or spirals that give a shaggy appearance.

**Grooming characteristics:**
- Moderate maintenance needs
- Some shedding possible
- Brushing 2-3 times weekly
- Versatile for various styles

#### 3. Straight/Flat Coat
Most similar to a Golden Retriever. Relatively rare in goldendoodles but does occur.

**Grooming characteristics:**
- Higher shedding
- Less prone to matting
- Different styling options than curly/wavy
- Needs different grooming approach

### The "Hypoallergenic" Myth

Many clients choose goldendoodles believing they're hypoallergenic. The reality is more complicated:

- No dog is truly hypoallergenic
- Poodle-type coats produce less dander
- Straight-coated goldendoodles may shed and produce allergens similarly to Golden Retrievers
- Individual allergies vary—some people react to specific dogs regardless of breed

**Client education point:** Set realistic expectations about shedding and allergen production based on the individual dog's coat type.

## Essential Grooming Tools

### Brushes and Combs
- **Slicker brush**: Primary tool for daily maintenance
- **Chris Christensen Big G or similar**: For working through longer coats
- **Metal greyhound comb**: For checking brush work and finding hidden mats
- **Dematting tools**: For working through tangles (carefully)

### Clippers and Blades
- **Professional clipper**: A5-style with detachable blades
- **Blade sizes to stock**:
  - #40: Pads, sanitary
  - #10: General body work, basis for guard combs
  - #7F: Shorter body styles
  - #4F, #5F: Medium body lengths
  - Guard combs: A through F for teddy bear styles

### Scissors
- **Straight shears**: 7-8 inch for body shaping
- **Curved shears**: For head, legs, round shapes
- **Thinning shears**: Blending, natural finish
- **Short straight scissors**: Detail work around face

### Drying Equipment
- **High-velocity dryer**: Essential for removing water and straightening coat
- **Stand dryer**: For fluff drying before scissoring

## Popular Goldendoodle Cuts

### The Teddy Bear Cut

The most requested goldendoodle style. Creates a round, fluffy appearance reminiscent of a stuffed animal.

**Specifications:**
- Body: 1-2 inches, even all over (guard comb or scissor)
- Head: Round, fuller than body, blended into ears
- Face: Rounded muzzle, eyes visible but not closely trimmed
- Ears: Blended into head, natural length or shortened
- Legs: Cylindrical, scissored to match body proportion
- Tail: Full, natural or shaped

**Execution:**
1. Bathe and fluff dry completely
2. Clip body to desired length with guard comb
3. Scissor legs to match body
4. Shape head into round dome
5. Blend all areas seamlessly
6. Round muzzle and clean around eyes
7. Shape tail

### The Puppy Cut

Similar to teddy bear but shorter, often used interchangeably by clients.

**Specifications:**
- Body: 1/2 to 1 inch
- Head: Proportional to body, round
- Face: Clean around eyes, rounded muzzle
- Legs: Shorter than teddy bear, still fluffy

**Best for:** Active dogs, easier maintenance, warm climates

### The Lamb Cut

Longer on the legs, shorter on the body—similar to the poodle lamb clip but less precise.

**Specifications:**
- Body: Short (3/8 to 1/2 inch or #5-#7 blade)
- Legs: Long, fluffy, scissored cylindrical
- Head: Round, blended
- Topknot: Can be fuller

**Good for:** Clients who want longer legs but struggle with body matting

### The Kennel Cut

The practical option when maintenance isn't happening or severe matting requires starting fresh.

**Specifications:**
- Body: Very short (#7 or #10)
- Head: Short but rounded
- Legs: Matching body or slightly longer
- All over: Clean, even, minimal styling

**Approach:** Frame positively—"a fresh start" rather than a punishment for matting

### The Miami/Bikini Cut

More stylised, similar to poodle trim but softer.

**Specifications:**
- Body: Short
- Legs: Pompoms or bracelets
- Tail: Pompom
- Head: Round with clean face optional

**Note:** Less common in goldendoodles but some clients request it

### The Lion Cut

Dramatic style leaving a full mane and shortened body.

**Specifications:**
- Rear half: Short
- Front/chest: Full, mane-like
- Tail: Pompom or lion tuft
- Legs: Short rear, fuller front

**Consideration:** Requires specific coat density to work well

## Grooming Process Step-by-Step

### 1. Assessment and Pre-Work

Before bathing:
- Evaluate coat condition and matting level
- Discuss style expectations with client
- Pre-brush if coat condition allows
- Clip sanitary area and pads
- Address severe mats before bath (wet mats tighten)

### 2. Bathing

- Wet coat thoroughly—dense coats take time to saturate
- Use appropriate shampoo (moisturising for curly coats)
- Work shampoo through entire coat
- Rinse completely—residue causes matting
- Condition if coat is dry or tangled
- Rinse again—thoroughly

### 3. Drying

**High-velocity drying:**
- Remove bulk water working in sections
- Stretch coat while drying to straighten curls
- Dry completely to skin

**Fluff drying:**
- Use stand dryer and brush simultaneously
- Lift coat while drying for volume
- Essential for scissor work
- Coat must be 100% dry

**Why drying matters:** Damp coat = uneven cut. Any moisture will curl differently when dry, creating an uneven finish.

### 4. Clipping

- Start with body using chosen blade or guard comb
- Work with the direction of growth for smooth finish
- Multiple passes may be needed
- Blend clipper work into scissor work at legs and head

### 5. Scissoring

**Body blending:**
- Smooth transitions from clipper work
- Remove any blade lines

**Legs:**
- Scissor cylindrical shape
- Blend into body at shoulders and hips
- Attention to elbow and hock areas

**Head:**
- Shape dome/round top
- Blend into ears
- Clean around eyes for visibility
- Shape muzzle—round, not pointed

**Feet:**
- Round "cat feet" or fuller "bunny feet"
- Tight around pads
- Blend into legs

### 6. Finishing

- Final comb-through
- Check symmetry
- Tidy any uneven areas
- Clean ears
- Nail trim
- Bow/bandana if desired

## Common Goldendoodle Grooming Challenges

### Matting

The number one issue with goldendoodles.

**Prevention education for clients:**
- Daily brushing for curly coats
- Every other day for wavy coats
- Focus on friction areas: behind ears, armpits, collar area, groin, between toes
- Use detangling spray
- Remove collar between walks

**When you find mats:**
- Assess if humanely brushable
- Quote additional time/cost for dematting
- Know when to shave down—it's kinder than painful brushing
- Document coat condition with photos

### Coat Transition (Puppy to Adult)

Goldendoodle puppies transition from puppy coat to adult coat between 6-12 months. During this time:
- Matting increases dramatically
- More frequent grooming needed
- Clients need extra education
- Consider shorter cuts during transition

### Ear Issues

Goldendoodles' floppy ears trap moisture and hair, leading to infections.

**Best practices:**
- Check ears at every groom
- Remove excess hair from canal if trained to do so
- Clean ears
- Advise clients on home ear care
- Refer persistent issues to vet

### Anxiety and Movement

Goldendoodles are generally friendly but can be energetic and wiggly.

**Strategies:**
- Allow time for dogs to settle
- Use positive reinforcement
- Take breaks for restless dogs
- Don't rush face work—build trust

## Pricing Goldendoodle Grooms

Goldendoodles often take longer than other breeds due to:
- Coat density requiring extended drying time
- Scissor work for teddy bear styles
- Dematting when needed

**Pricing considerations:**
- Charge appropriately for time, not just size
- Premium for heavy scissor work
- Dematting fees when applicable
- Consider "teddy bear" as a premium style
- Be clear about additional costs for coat condition

**Typical time requirements:**
- Standard goldendoodle teddy bear: 2-3 hours
- Mini goldendoodle: 1.5-2 hours
- Severely matted: Add 30-60+ minutes
- Simple kennel cut: Reduce by 30-45 minutes

## Client Communication

### Setting Expectations

Before the first groom:
- Explain coat type and maintenance needs
- Discuss realistic style options
- Clarify home brushing requirements
- Set grooming frequency expectations

### Rebooking

Goldendoodles typically need grooming every 4-8 weeks depending on:
- Coat type (curlier = more frequent)
- Style (longer = more frequent)
- Client's home maintenance
- Dog's lifestyle and activity

Use [pet grooming software](/pet-grooming-software/) to:
- Schedule recurring appointments
- Send reminder notifications
- Track coat condition over time
- Note preferred styles and products

## Health Considerations

### Skin Issues
- Golden Retrievers are prone to skin problems
- Goldendoodles may inherit this tendency
- Watch for hot spots, allergies, dry skin
- Use appropriate shampoos

### Eye Care
- Some goldendoodles have eye drainage issues
- Keep face hair trimmed for visibility
- Clean tear stains
- Watch for irritation from hair in eyes

### Joint Considerations
- Larger goldendoodles may have joint issues
- Be mindful of table positioning
- Don't over-extend legs during grooming
- Note any sensitivity for future visits

## Summary

Goldendoodle grooming requires:
1. **Assessment** of individual coat type
2. **Client education** about realistic expectations and maintenance
3. **Proper tools** including guard combs and quality scissors
4. **Complete drying** before any scissor work
5. **Patience** for thorough work on dense coats

The teddy bear cut remains most popular, but adapt styles to each dog's coat type and each client's maintenance ability.
