Running a successful dog daycare means juggling bookings, managing playgroups, tracking vaccinations, communicating with pet parents, and somehow finding time to actually care for the dogs. The right software transforms this chaos into smooth operations.

This guide covers everything you need to know about dog daycare software in 2026: what features matter, how much you should expect to pay, which platforms suit different business sizes, and how to evaluate your options.

## What Is Dog Daycare Software?

Dog daycare software is a specialised management platform designed for pet care businesses. Unlike generic booking systems, it includes features tailored specifically to daycare operations:

- **Online booking and scheduling** with capacity limits by playgroup
- **Pet profiles** with vaccination tracking, feeding notes, and behavioural observations
- **Owner portals** where clients manage bookings and update pet information
- **Staff scheduling** matched to dog-to-staff ratios
- **Automated reminders** for bookings, vaccinations, and follow-ups
- **Daily report cards** with photos to keep pet parents engaged
- **Payment processing** with package and membership support
- **Reporting and analytics** for occupancy, revenue, and retention metrics

The goal is simple: reduce administrative burden so you can focus on providing excellent care.

## Why Your Daycare Needs Management Software

### The Manual Process Problem

Without software, daycare owners typically manage operations through:

- Phone calls and paper calendars for bookings
- Spreadsheets for client records and vaccination tracking
- Separate tools for invoicing and payments
- Manual reminder calls and texts
- Handwritten report cards (or none at all)

This approach works for very small operations, but quickly becomes unsustainable. Staff spend hours on administration instead of supervision. Booking errors frustrate clients. Vaccination lapses create liability. And there's no data to inform business decisions.

### What Software Changes

Modern daycare software consolidates everything into one system:

| Manual Process | With Software |
|---------------|---------------|
| 15+ mins per booking (phone tag, checking availability) | 2 mins (client self-books online) |
| Hours weekly on reminder calls | Automated SMS/email reminders |
| Paper vaccination records, easy to miss expiries | Automatic alerts when vaccinations due |
| End-of-day report writing | Digital report cards with templates |
| Monthly invoicing headaches | Automatic billing and payment collection |
| No visibility into business trends | Real-time occupancy and revenue dashboards |

The time savings alone typically justify the subscription cost within the first month.

## Essential Features to Look For

### Platform Overviews

**Gingr** is popular with medium to large facilities. Strong multi-location support, robust CRM, and integrated payments. The interface has a learning curve but offers deep customisation. Customer support response times vary.

**PetExec** offers comprehensive features including POS and retail modules. Well-suited for facilities offering multiple services. The interface feels dated but functionality is solid. Strong user community.

**Revelation Pets** focuses on simplicity and ease of use. Ideal for smaller daycares wanting core features without complexity. Pricing is accessible. Advanced reporting is limited compared to larger platforms.

**PawLoyalty** excels at daycare-specific features like staff scheduling and customer engagement tools. Good balance of features and usability. Some advanced features require higher-tier plans.

**ProPet** is a Canadian-developed all-in-one system covering boarding, daycare, and grooming. Broad feature set with reasonable pricing. Mobile experience could be more polished.

**Kennel Booker** offers good value for UK and European users. Intuitive interface, responsive support. Customisation options are somewhat limited.

**PetLinx** is the budget-friendly option with both cloud and desktop deployment. Interface is dated but functional. Good for very small facilities with tight budgets.

## Pricing Guide

### Typical Cost Ranges

Dog daycare software pricing typically falls into three tiers:

**Entry Level ($30-60/month)**
- Core booking and scheduling
- Basic client management
- Standard reminders
- Limited reporting
- Best for: Solo operators, very small daycares

**Mid-Range ($60-120/month)**
- Full feature set
- Advanced reporting
- Staff scheduling
- Custom branding
- Best for: Small to medium daycares (10-40 dogs/day capacity)

**Enterprise ($120-250+/month)**
- Multi-location support
- API access and integrations
- Dedicated support
- Custom development
- Best for: Large facilities, franchise operations

### Hidden Costs to Consider

Beyond monthly subscriptions, budget for:

- **Setup fees**: $0-500 depending on platform
- **Payment processing**: Typically 2.5-3% per transaction
- **Additional users**: Some platforms charge per staff login
- **Premium features**: Report cards, webcam integration may cost extra
- **Data migration**: Moving from another system may incur fees

### ROI Calculation

For a daycare charging $40/day with 20-dog capacity:

**Time Savings**
- 10 hours/week admin reduction x $20/hour = $800/month saved

**No-Show Reduction**
- 5% improvement x 440 dog-days/month x $40 = $880/month recovered

**Increased Bookings**
- 10% more bookings from online convenience = $1,760/month additional revenue

Even conservative estimates show software paying for itself many times over.

## How to Choose the Right Software

### By Business Size

**Small Daycares (Under 20 dogs/day capacity)**

Priorities: Ease of use, affordable pricing, core features
Recommended: Revelation Pets, PetLinx, Kennel Booker
Avoid: Over-featured platforms with steep learning curves

**Medium Daycares (20-50 dogs/day capacity)**

Priorities: Staff scheduling, robust reporting, growth support
Recommended: PawLoyalty, ProPet, Gingr
Consider: Scalability for future expansion

**Large Facilities (50+ dogs/day or multi-location)**

Priorities: Multi-location management, API integrations, enterprise support
Recommended: Gingr, PetExec, PetCare.Software
Requirement: Dedicated account management

### By Service Mix

**Daycare Only**
Any platform works. Choose based on size and budget.

**Daycare + Boarding**
Ensure the platform handles overnight stays well. Check reservation calendar views for multi-day bookings.

**Daycare + Grooming**
Look for integrated grooming scheduling. Gingr and PetExec handle this well.

**Full-Service (Daycare + Boarding + Grooming + Training)**
Need comprehensive platforms. PetExec and ProPet offer the broadest service coverage.

### Evaluation Checklist

Before committing to any platform:

- [ ] Take the free trial seriously (don't just click around)
- [ ] Enter real data and test actual workflows
- [ ] Have staff members test the interface
- [ ] Test the client booking experience yourself
- [ ] Review the mobile experience
- [ ] Contact customer support with questions
- [ ] Ask for references from similar-sized businesses
- [ ] Understand the contract terms and cancellation policy
- [ ] Confirm data export options if you need to switch later

## Implementation Guide

### Preparing for Setup

Before going live:

1. **Clean your data**: Organise client records, update contact info, verify vaccination dates
2. **Document your processes**: Write down your booking rules, pricing, policies
3. **Prepare your team**: Explain the change, address concerns, identify champions
4. **Set a timeline**: Allow 2-4 weeks for setup, testing, and training

### Data Migration

If switching from another system:

- Export all client and pet data
- Map fields to the new system
- Test import with a small batch first
- Verify critical data (vaccinations, balances) manually
- Keep the old system accessible during transition

### Staff Training

Effective training includes:

- **Initial overview**: 1-2 hours covering core concepts
- **Role-specific training**: Front desk, playgroup supervisors, managers
- **Hands-on practice**: Use training mode or test accounts
- **Quick reference guides**: Laminated cards for common tasks
- **Ongoing support**: Designate an internal expert for questions

### Going Live

Launch strategies:

**Big Bang**: Switch everything at once on a specific date. Simpler but riskier. Best for small teams.

**Parallel Running**: Run old and new systems together for 1-2 weeks. More work but safer. Recommended for larger operations.

**Phased Rollout**: Start with one service or client segment, expand gradually. Best for multi-service facilities.

## Common Concerns Addressed

### "Our clients won't use online booking"

This concern rarely materialises. Once online booking is available, adoption is typically 60-80% within three months. The convenience is compelling. Keep phone booking available for those who prefer it.

### "We're too small for software"

Even solo operators benefit from automated reminders, vaccination tracking, and professional booking. The smallest plans cost less than one day's revenue. The question isn't whether you can afford software—it's whether you can afford not to have it.

### "Switching seems overwhelming"

It's work, but it's temporary work with permanent benefits. Most platforms offer migration support. Set realistic timelines and tackle it systematically.

### "What if the company goes out of business?"

Choose established vendors with years of track record. Ensure you can export your data. Avoid platforms that lock you in without data portability.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is dog daycare software and who needs it?

Dog daycare software is a specialised management system designed for pet care businesses. It handles bookings, client management, vaccination tracking, staff scheduling, payments, and communications. Any daycare handling more than a handful of dogs benefits from purpose-built software rather than generic tools or manual processes.

### How much does dog daycare software cost?

Entry-level plans start around $30-60/month for small operations. Mid-range platforms cost $60-120/month with fuller feature sets. Enterprise solutions for large or multi-location facilities run $150-250+/month. Most offer free trials to test before committing.

### What features are essential for dog daycare software?

Core essentials include online booking with capacity management, vaccination tracking with expiry alerts, automated reminders, payment processing, and basic reporting. Nice-to-haves include digital report cards, staff scheduling, and mobile apps for owners.

### How long does it take to implement daycare software?

For small facilities, expect 1-2 weeks from purchase to full operation. Medium-sized daycares typically need 2-4 weeks including data migration and staff training. Large or multi-location operations may require 4-8 weeks for comprehensive implementation.

### Can dog daycare software integrate with my existing tools?

Most platforms offer integrations with payment processors (Stripe, Square), accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero), and marketing tools. Check specific integration availability during evaluation—this varies significantly between platforms.

### What's the difference between dog daycare software and kennel software?

The terms overlap significantly. "Kennel software" often emphasises overnight boarding, while "daycare software" focuses on same-day care with hourly or daily rates. Most modern platforms handle both. Choose based on your primary service and check that the platform supports your specific needs.

### Is cloud-based or desktop software better for daycares?

Cloud-based software dominates the market for good reasons: access from anywhere, automatic updates, no server maintenance, and better mobile support. Desktop solutions are rare now and generally not recommended unless you have specific offline requirements.

### How do I get staff to actually use new software?

Involve staff in the selection process. Provide thorough training with hands-on practice. Start with features that make their jobs easier. Designate internal champions. Be patient during the learning curve but consistent about adoption expectations.

## Making Your Decision

Choosing dog daycare software isn't just a technology decision—it's a business decision that affects your operations, your staff, and your clients' experience.

The best approach:

1. **Assess your needs honestly**: Current size, growth plans, pain points, budget
2. **Shortlist 2-3 platforms**: Based on size fit and feature requirements
3. **Trial seriously**: Real data, real workflows, real staff testing
4. **Talk to references**: Other daycare owners using the platform
5. **Consider the relationship**: You'll work with this vendor for years

Take your time with this decision, but don't delay indefinitely. The sooner you implement good software, the sooner you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.
