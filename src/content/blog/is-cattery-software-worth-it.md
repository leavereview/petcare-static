Cat boarding is a smaller market than dog boarding, and catteries often operate on tighter margins. Does it make sense to invest in management software? Here's an honest look at the costs and benefits for small cattery owners.

## Understanding Cattery-Specific Needs

Before discussing ROI, it's worth noting what makes catteries different:

- **Individual housing:** Cats rarely share units (unlike dog playgroups)
- **FIV/FeLV tracking:** Additional health screening requirements
- **Feeding complexity:** Cats are notoriously particular about food
- **Lower average rates:** Cat boarding typically costs less than dog boarding
- **Smaller scale:** Many catteries operate with 10-25 units

These factors affect the software value proposition.

## The Real Costs

### Subscription Pricing

For small catteries, expect:

- **Entry-level:** £30-50/month
- **Mid-tier:** £50-80/month
- **Setup fees:** Usually waived or £0-150

Note: There's no "cattery premium"—pricing is the same as general boarding software.

### Time Investment

- **Setup:** 3-6 hours
- **Data entry:** 1-3 hours (catteries typically have fewer clients)
- **Training:** 1-2 hours
- **Learning curve:** 2-3 weeks

### Customisation Effort

Most platforms aren't cattery-specific. You may need to:
- Configure custom fields for FIV/FeLV tracking
- Adjust vaccination settings for feline vaccines
- Set up cat-specific feeding templates

This adds 1-2 hours to initial setup.

## The Benefits

### Time Savings

| Task | Manual | With Software |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Booking (phone/email) | 10-12 mins | Self-service |
| Checking FIV/FeLV status | 5-8 mins | Instant flag |
| Vaccination verification | 5 mins | Automatic |
| Feeding notes lookup | 3-5 mins | Immediate |
| Invoice creation | 10 mins | Automatic |

For a 20-unit cattery, expect 4-6 hours weekly time savings.

### Revenue Protection

**No-show reduction:** Automated reminders work just as well for cat owners. Expect 30-50% reduction in no-shows.

At £20/night with 1-2 no-shows per week:
- Weekly recovery: £10-20
- Monthly: £40-80

**Online booking capture:** Cat owners are just as likely to book online at 10pm as dog owners. 24/7 availability captures bookings you'd otherwise miss.

### Health Record Accuracy

Cattery-specific benefits:
- FIV/FeLV test tracking with expiry alerts
- FVRCP vaccination monitoring
- Detailed feeding preferences stored per cat
- Medication tracking for diabetic or hyperthyroid cats

One missed health check could result in disease transmission—software prevents this.

### Professional Presentation

Cat owners are often particularly discerning. A professional booking experience:
- Signals that you take care seriously
- Differentiates you from informal operations
- Justifies premium pricing

## ROI Calculation for Small Catteries

**Scenario:** 15-unit cattery, £22/night average, 60% occupancy

| Factor | Monthly Value |
|--------|--------------|
| Admin time savings (5 hrs/week × £14) | +£280 |
| No-show reduction (4 nights × £22 × 40%) | +£35 |
| Booking capture (2 extra bookings) | +£88 |
| Error/compliance prevention | +£50 |
| **Total monthly benefit** | **+£453** |
| Software cost | -£45 |
| **Net monthly gain** | **+£408** |

The ROI is positive, though smaller in absolute terms than dog boarding due to lower rates.

## When Cattery Software IS Worth It

**Clear yes:**
- You have more than 10 units
- You're open year-round (not seasonal hobby)
- You have staff or plan to hire
- FIV/FeLV tracking is important to you
- You want to grow
- Clients ask about online booking

**Probably yes:**
- Solo operation with 15+ units
- You also offer other services
- Competitors have modern systems

## When It Might Not Be Worth It

**Possible no:**
- Fewer than 8-10 units
- Seasonal operation (holidays only)
- Informal arrangement with regulars only
- No growth ambitions
- Very low-tech client base

## Cattery-Specific Software Considerations

### What to Check Before Committing

1. **Can you add FIV/FeLV tracking?** Either built-in or via custom fields
2. **Does it support feline vaccine types?** FVRCP, not just DHPP
3. **How detailed are feeding fields?** Cats need brand, wet/dry preference, portion sizes
4. **Are there other cattery customers?** Ask for references
5. **Can you configure unit types?** Standard, premium, family units for multiple cats

### Platforms That Work for Catteries

Most general boarding platforms work with configuration:
- Revelation Pets (good for smaller operations)
- ProPet (handles multiple species well)
- Kennel Booker (popular with UK catteries)
- Gingr (if you need more features)

No platform is built exclusively for catteries—the market is too small.

## Making Your Decision

### Calculate Your Admin Hours

Track for one week:
- Time spent on booking calls/emails
- Time checking vaccination records
- Time managing feeding instructions
- Time on invoicing

Multiply by your hourly rate. Compare to software cost.

### Assess Your Pain Points

Is your biggest challenge:
- Missed bookings? → Online booking helps
- Vaccination tracking? → Automated alerts help
- Feeding mistakes? → Documented notes help
- Invoicing time? → Automation helps

Ensure software addresses your specific issues.

### Trial With Real Data

During free trial:
- Set up FIV/FeLV custom fields
- Enter your actual cats and their requirements
- Process a few real bookings
- Test from the cat owner's perspective

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there software specifically for catteries?

No dedicated cattery-only software exists. The market is too small. General boarding platforms work well with proper configuration.

### How do I track FIV/FeLV in general software?

Use custom fields. Most platforms allow you to create additional health record fields with date tracking and expiry alerts.

### Do cat owners use online booking?

Yes. Adoption rates are similar to dog owners—60-80% once available. Cat owners are no less tech-savvy than dog owners.

### Is the ROI lower for catteries than kennels?

In absolute pounds, often yes—because nightly rates are lower. As a percentage of revenue, it's comparable. Software still pays for itself.

### What if I board both cats and dogs?

This is ideal for software. You get unified client management, combined billing, and can cross-sell services. Most platforms handle multiple species.

## Conclusion

For commercial catteries with more than 10-12 units, software is worth the investment. The ROI is positive, and the professionalism it brings helps compete with larger facilities.

For very small operations (under 10 units), the calculation is closer. If you're happy with your current systems and not planning to grow, you might defer the investment. But if you're losing bookings, making errors, or spending excessive time on admin, software solves those problems regardless of size.

Take a free trial. Configure it for cats properly. The answer will become clear.
