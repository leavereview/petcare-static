Strategic partnerships with veterinarians, trainers, and other pet professionals can transform your boarding or daycare business. These relationships drive high-quality referrals, enhance your service offering, and build credibility in your community.

## Why Partnerships Matter

### The Referral Power of Vets

When pet parents ask their vet "Where should I board my dog?", that recommendation carries enormous weight. Veterinarians are trusted advisors—their endorsement is worth more than any advertisement.

### The Value of Trainer Relationships

Dog trainers work with owners actively investing in their pets. These are ideal customers for premium boarding and daycare services.

### Mutual Benefit

Good partnerships benefit everyone:
- **You get:** Quality referrals, credibility, expert advice access
- **Partners get:** Trusted recommendation for their clients, potential referrals back, community relationships

## Building Veterinary Partnerships

### Identifying the Right Practices

Look for:
- Practices within 15-20 minutes of your facility
- Vets who board clients' pets themselves (they may want an alternative to recommend)
- Practices that align with your care philosophy (fear-free, positive approaches)
- Busy practices that need reliable boarding recommendations

### Making the Approach

**Don't:** Walk in unannounced, immediately ask for referrals, or be salesy.

**Do:**
1. Call to schedule a brief meeting with the practice manager or head vet
2. Introduce yourself and your facility professionally
3. Offer a tour of your facility
4. Ask how you can support their clients (not how they can help you)
5. Follow up with information about your services

### What to Offer Vets

- **Emergency contact availability:** Be reachable when boarding pets have medical issues
- **Clear communication protocols:** How you'll notify them and owners of health concerns
- **Transportation to their clinic:** If pets need veterinary care during boarding
- **Vaccination compliance:** Assure them you enforce proper vaccination requirements
- **Professional documentation:** Share your health protocols, insurance, and licensing

### Building the Relationship

- **Regular check-ins:** Visit quarterly, not just when you need something
- **Referral acknowledgment:** Thank them when they send clients (handwritten notes work well)
- **Reciprocal referrals:** Recommend their practice to your clients
- **Joint education:** Offer to provide information on boarding prep for their clients

### Red Flags That Damage Vet Relationships

- Pets returning from boarding sick or injured without communication
- Ignoring vaccination requirements
- Being unreachable during emergencies
- Badmouthing other facilities or vets
- Expecting referrals without providing value

## Building Trainer Partnerships

### Types of Trainers to Partner With

- **Puppy class instructors:** New owners need socialisation and often daycare
- **Behaviour specialists:** Clients with challenging dogs may need structured daycare
- **Private trainers:** Work with committed owners who invest in their pets
- **Agility/sport trainers:** Engaged owners with active dogs

### What You Offer Trainers

- **Reinforcement of training:** Staff who follow their techniques
- **Structured socialisation:** Controlled environment for behaviour practice
- **Observation notes:** Feedback on how dogs behave in group settings
- **Referrals:** Recommend their services to clients who need training

### What Trainers Offer You

- **Quality referrals:** Owners already investing in their dogs
- **Behaviour expertise:** Advice on managing challenging dogs
- **Staff training:** Workshops on handling, body language, positive techniques
- **Credibility:** Association with respected professionals

### Partnership Structures

| Type | Description | Benefit |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Referral exchange | Simple mutual recommendations | Low effort, steady leads |
| On-site training | Trainer offers classes at your facility | Revenue share, client convenience |
| Staff training | Trainer provides team workshops | Improved skills, credibility |
| Joint packages | Combined daycare + training offerings | Premium positioning, bundled value |

## Other Valuable Partnerships

### Groomers

- Cross-referral relationship
- "Bath and brush" add-ons during boarding
- Co-located services if space allows
- Joint promotions

### Pet Stores

- Display your brochures/cards
- Referral programme for their staff
- Joint events (adoption days, meet-and-greets)
- Bulk supply purchasing

### Dog Walkers and Pet Sitters

- They handle clients who can't board
- You handle clients they can't serve (holidays, emergencies)
- Not competition—complementary services

### Rescue Organisations

- Foster support during busy periods
- Adoption event hosting
- Community goodwill
- Staff volunteer opportunities

## Making Partnerships Work

### Formal vs. Informal Agreements

**Informal:** Handshake referral relationships work for simple exchanges. Most vet and trainer partnerships operate this way.

**Formal:** Written agreements for:
- Revenue sharing arrangements
- On-site service providers
- Exclusive referral commitments
- Joint marketing investments

### Communication Essentials

- **Clear expectations:** What each party will do
- **Regular check-ins:** Quarterly at minimum
- **Issue resolution:** How to handle problems
- **Feedback loops:** Share what's working and what isn't

### Measuring Partnership Value

Track for each partner:
- Referrals received
- Revenue from those referrals
- Referrals you've sent back
- Joint activities completed

If a partnership isn't producing value for either side, address it or move on.

## Common Partnership Mistakes

**Being transactional:** Only reaching out when you want something

**Over-promising:** Committing to things you can't deliver

**Ignoring reciprocity:** Taking referrals without giving back

**Poor communication:** Not following up on issues involving shared clients

**Inconsistent quality:** Referral partners stake their reputation on recommending you

## Getting Started

### Week 1-2: Research

- List veterinary practices within 20-minute radius
- Identify trainers active in your area
- Note groomers, pet stores, and walkers

### Week 3-4: Prioritise

- Rank by potential value and accessibility
- Identify 3-5 priority partners to approach first
- Research each (website, reviews, approach philosophy)

### Month 2: Outreach

- Schedule introductory meetings
- Visit practices to introduce yourself
- Offer facility tours
- Leave professional materials

### Month 3+: Nurture

- Follow up on initial meetings
- Begin referral tracking
- Plan joint activities or events
- Maintain regular contact

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I offer referral fees to vets?

Generally no. Veterinary ethics guidelines often prohibit accepting fees for referrals. Focus on providing value and being a trustworthy recommendation.

### What if a vet competitor also boards dogs?

Many vets offer boarding but prefer to refer out. They may not want the operational hassle. Approach them professionally—they may be relieved to have a quality alternative.

### How do I handle it when a referred client has a bad experience?

Communicate proactively with the referral partner. Own the issue, explain what happened, and describe how you're preventing recurrence. Transparency preserves relationships.

### Can partnerships work in competitive markets?

Yes. Even in crowded markets, there's room for quality referral relationships. Focus on what makes your facility distinctive and find partners whose clients match your positioning.

### How much time should I invest in partnerships?

Budget 2-4 hours monthly for partnership activities—visits, follow-ups, joint planning. The ROI on this time typically exceeds other marketing investments.

## Conclusion

Partnerships with veterinarians, trainers, and other pet professionals are among the highest-ROI marketing activities for boarding and daycare businesses. They take time to build but deliver consistently once established.

Start with one or two key relationships. Deliver exceptional value. Let results build naturally. The best partnerships compound over years—invest in them accordingly.
