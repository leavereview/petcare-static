Managing a dog boarding facility involves coordinating overnight stays, tracking feeding schedules, handling check-ins across multiple days, and keeping anxious pet parents informed while their dogs are away. The right software makes this manageable—the wrong choice (or no software at all) leads to chaos.

This guide covers everything about dog boarding software: what features you actually need, how platforms compare, realistic pricing expectations, and how to evaluate options for your specific situation.

## What Is Dog Boarding Software?

Dog boarding software is a management platform designed for facilities that offer overnight pet stays. While it shares features with daycare software, boarding-specific functionality includes:

- **Multi-day reservation management** with arrival and departure tracking
- **Kennel/run assignment** optimising space utilisation
- **Feeding schedule management** for multiple meals across stays
- **Medication administration tracking** with alerts and logging
- **Extended care documentation** for longer stays
- **Boarding-specific reporting** (occupancy by night, average stay length)

The platform handles everything from initial booking through checkout, reducing manual tracking and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks during busy periods.

## Why Boarding Facilities Need Specialised Software

### The Boarding-Specific Challenge

Boarding differs from daycare in important ways:

- **Longer stays** mean more variables to track (feeding, medications, exercise schedules)
- **24/7 responsibility** for animals in your care
- **Higher anxiety** from pet parents who are often travelling
- **Peak demand** concentrated around holidays and school breaks
- **Run/kennel management** requires space optimisation

Generic booking tools don't account for these realities. Spreadsheets work until they don't—usually during your busiest period when a booking error or missed medication creates a crisis.

### What Changes With Proper Software

| Manual Process | With Boarding Software |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Phone bookings, checking paper calendar | Online booking with real-time availability |
| Handwritten feeding/medication logs | Digital tracking with completion alerts |
| Manual run assignments | Automated kennel management |
| Calling clients with updates | Automated daily updates with photos |
| Paper invoices after checkout | Pre-payment and automatic billing |
| Guessing at occupancy patterns | Data-driven capacity forecasting |

## Essential Features for Boarding Software

- **Exercise and activity logging**
- **Behavioural observations** throughout the stay
- **Elimination tracking** (important for identifying health issues)

### Pet Parent Communication

Reducing anxiety for clients away from their pets:

- **Automated arrival confirmations**
- **Daily update messages** (ideally with photos)

*Pricing verified January 2026. Confirm current rates with vendors.*

### Platform Strengths

**Gingr** handles boarding well with strong reservation management and multi-location support. The visual calendar makes run management intuitive. Better suited for medium to large facilities due to pricing and complexity.

**PetExec** offers comprehensive boarding features with good feeding and medication tracking. POS integration useful for facilities with retail. Interface is functional if not modern.

**Revelation Pets** provides solid boarding basics at accessible pricing. Good for smaller facilities. Feeding and medication tracking is more basic than competitors.

**ProPet** balances features and pricing well. Strong in Canadian market but works internationally. Handles combined boarding and daycare operations effectively.

**Kennel Booker** offers good value for UK facilities. Clean interface, straightforward boarding management. Customisation options are limited compared to larger platforms.

**Kennel Connection** is a long-established player with deep boarding functionality. Desktop-focused with more limited mobile experience. Strong with larger traditional kennels.

## Pricing for Boarding Software

### Cost Expectations

Boarding software typically costs slightly more than daycare-only solutions due to additional complexity:

**Small Facilities (Under 20 runs)**
- Budget: $35-70/month
- Focus: Core booking, basic care tracking
- Platforms: Revelation Pets, Kennel Booker, PetLinx

**Medium Facilities (20-50 runs)**
- Budget: $70-150/month
- Focus: Full features, reporting, staff tools
- Platforms: ProPet, PetExec, Gingr

**Large Facilities (50+ runs or multi-location)**
- Budget: $150-300+/month
- Focus: Enterprise features, integrations, dedicated support
- Platforms: Gingr, PetExec enterprise, PetCare.Software

### ROI Considerations

For a facility with 30 runs averaging $50/night:

**Operational Savings**
- 8 hours/week admin reduction = $640/month (at $20/hour)

**Reduced Errors**
- 2 fewer booking mistakes/month = $100 saved (makeup discounts, refunds)

**Improved Occupancy**
- 5% better utilisation = $2,250/month additional revenue

**Total Monthly Benefit**: ~$3,000 vs. ~$100 software cost

## Boarding Software vs. Manual Systems

### When Manual Works

Honestly, manual systems can work for:
- Very small operations (under 10 runs)
- Stable, predictable booking patterns
- Owner-operated with no staff handovers
- Simple service offerings

### When You Need Software

Switch to software when:
- Booking errors start occurring
- Staff struggle with handovers
- Pet parents complain about communication
- You can't answer "how full are we next month?"
- Medication or feeding mistakes happen
- You're turning away bookings you could accommodate

The transition point usually comes around 15-20 runs or when you hire your first non-family staff member.

## Implementation Considerations

### Data to Prepare

Before implementation, gather:
- Client contact information
- Pet records (breeds, weights, ages, temperaments)
- Vaccination records with expiry dates
- Feeding and medication requirements
- Historical booking data (if available)
- Pricing structure and packages

### Staff Training Focus

Boarding staff need training on:
- Reservation creation and modification
- Check-in and check-out procedures
- Feeding and medication logging
- Daily update creation
- Problem escalation

Allow extra training time for medication tracking—errors here have serious consequences.

### Go-Live Strategy

For boarding facilities, consider timing carefully:

**Good times to switch:**
- Slow season (January-February, September-October)
- After a holiday rush, before the next one

**Bad times to switch:**
- Week before Thanksgiving/Christmas
- Summer holiday peak
- Any time you're already at capacity

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between boarding software and kennel software?

The terms overlap significantly. "Boarding software" emphasises overnight stays, while "kennel software" is a broader term that may include boarding, daycare, and other services. Most platforms marketed as either handle both. Focus on features rather than labels.

### Do I need separate software for boarding and daycare?

No. Modern platforms handle both services in one system, with unified client records, combined billing, and coordinated scheduling. Separate systems create data silos and extra work.

### How do I handle feeding instructions in software?

Good boarding software includes detailed feeding fields: food type/brand, portion size, meal times, and special instructions. Staff see this information when checking dogs in and during feeding times. Completion logging provides accountability.

### Can boarding software track medications?

Yes. Look for medication modules that include drug name, dosage, administration time, and completion tracking. Better platforms send alerts when medications are due and flag missed doses for management review.

### What about webcams for boarding clients?

Some platforms integrate with webcam systems, allowing pet parents to view their dogs remotely. This is increasingly expected for premium boarding. Check integration options with your preferred webcam provider.

### How do I manage holiday pricing in software?

Most platforms support date-based pricing rules. Set higher rates for holiday periods (Christmas, Thanksgiving, summer weeks) and the software applies correct pricing automatically during booking.

### What reports should boarding software provide?

Essential reports: occupancy rate (by night and by week), revenue by time period, average length of stay, cancellation rates, and client retention. Advanced: forecasting, staff utilisation, revenue per run.

### Can clients book boarding online themselves?

Yes, and they should. Online booking is available on all modern platforms. Clients see real-time availability, select their run type, enter pet information, and pay deposits—all without staff involvement.

## Choosing Your Platform

### Evaluation Process

1. **List your must-haves**: Features you cannot operate without
2. **Identify nice-to-haves**: Features that would improve operations
3. **Set your budget**: Monthly and setup costs you can afford
4. **Shortlist 3 platforms**: Based on size, features, and price fit
5. **Trial each seriously**: Real data, real workflows
6. **Check references**: Talk to similar facilities using the platform
7. **Negotiate**: Multi-year commitments often come with discounts

### Red Flags

Avoid platforms that:
- Don't offer free trials
- Can't provide references for your facility size
- Have limited or no data export options
- Require long contracts without cancellation terms
- Haven't updated significantly in years

### Making the Decision

The "best" boarding software is the one that:
- Fits your budget sustainably
- Handles your specific services
- Your team will actually use
- Grows with your facility

There's no universally perfect platform. Focus on fit for your situation, trial thoroughly, and make a confident decision.
