International Dog Day (August 26) is one of the biggest opportunities on the pet business calendar. With millions of dog owners celebrating their furry friends, it's the perfect time to boost visibility, attract new customers, and reward loyal ones.

This guide covers proven marketing strategies for [dog daycares](/dog-daycare-software/), [boarding facilities](/dog-boarding-software/), groomers, and other pet businesses looking to make the most of this celebration.

## When Is International Dog Day?

International Dog Day falls on **August 26th** every year. It was founded in 2004 to celebrate all dogs—purebred and mixed breed alike—and to raise awareness about dog adoption.

The day has grown into a major social media event, with hashtags like #InternationalDogDay and #NationalDogDay generating millions of posts. For pet businesses, this built-in attention makes it an ideal time to run promotions.

## Marketing Ideas for Dog Daycares and Boarding Facilities

### 1. Free Day of Daycare Giveaway

Run a social media contest where one lucky winner gets a free day of daycare. Entry requirements could include:
- Following your account
- Sharing a photo of their dog with a specific hashtag
- Tagging friends who are dog owners

This drives engagement while expanding your reach to potential new customers.

### 2. Discounted First Visit

Offer new customers 50% off their first daycare visit if they book during Dog Day week. This lowers the barrier for trial visits and can convert into regular customers.

### 3. Photo Contest

Host a "Dog Day Photo Contest" where clients submit photos of their dogs at your facility. Winners could receive:
- A month of free daycare
- A gift basket with treats and toys
- Credit toward boarding services

Display entries in your facility and on social media to showcase your happy clients.

### 4. Loyalty Rewards Bonus

Double loyalty points or stamps for all visits during Dog Day week. If you use [dog daycare software](/dog-daycare-software/) with built-in loyalty tracking, this is easy to implement and rewards your best customers.

### 5. "Bring a Friend" Promotion

Existing customers who refer a new client during Dog Day week receive a free day of daycare for their own pup. The referred friend gets a discounted trial.

## Marketing Ideas for Groomers

### 1. Dog Day Spa Package

Create a special "Dog Day Spa Package" that includes premium services:
- Full groom with premium shampoo
- Nail trim with paw moisturizer
- Bandana or bow
- Photo session
- Small treat bag

Price it as a special value package available only during Dog Day week.

### 2. Before/After Photo Campaign

Encourage clients to share before/after grooming photos using your branded hashtag. Feature the best transformations on your social media and consider a prize for the most dramatic makeover.

### 3. Express Services

Offer quick "Dog Day Touch-Up" services at a lower price point—nail trim, ear cleaning, and brush-out. This attracts customers who might not book a full groom but want to pamper their pet on the special day.

### 4. First-Time Grooming Discount

New customers booking their first grooming appointment during Dog Day week get 20% off. Include a branded bandana as a gift to encourage social sharing.
