Pricing your dog boarding services correctly balances profitability with competitiveness. This guide covers proven pricing strategies for boarding facilities.

## Dog Boarding Pricing Models

### Per-Night Pricing

The most common model. Charge a flat rate for each night of boarding.

**Typical rates (UK):**
- Basic kennel: £20-35/night
- Premium kennel: £35-50/night
- Luxury suite: £50-80+/night

**Pros:** Simple to understand, easy to quote
**Cons:** Doesn't account for variable costs

### Tiered Pricing

Different rates based on accommodation type:

| Tier | Features | Price Range |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Standard | Basic kennel, shared outdoor time | £20-30/night |
| Comfort | Larger space, more outdoor time | £30-40/night |
| Premium | Private suite, enrichment included | £40-55/night |
| Luxury | XL suite, webcam, premium add-ons | £55-80+/night |

### Multi-Pet Discounts

Common discount structures:
- Second pet from same household: 10-20% off
- Third pet and beyond: 15-25% off

## Creating Profitable Packages

### Stay Packages

Bundle multiple nights at a discount:

- **Weekend Package** (Fri-Sun): 5-10% off
- **Week Package** (7 nights): 10-15% off
- **Extended Stay** (14+ nights): 15-20% off

### Add-On Services

Increase revenue per booking with extras:

- **Extra walks/playtime:** £5-15/session
- **Bath on departure:** £15-35
- **Nail trim:** £10-15
- **One-on-one enrichment:** £10-20/session
- **Photo/video updates:** £5-10 (or included in premium)
- **Late pickup:** £15-25

### Seasonal Pricing

Adjust for demand:

- **Peak season** (Christmas, summer holidays): 15-25% higher
- **Off-peak** (January, September): Regular or discounted
- **Last-minute bookings:** Premium for same-week bookings

## Setting Your Prices

### 1. Calculate Your Costs

Know your true costs per boarding:

- Staff wages per occupied kennel
- Food and supplies
- Facility overhead (rent, utilities, insurance)
- Equipment depreciation
- Software and admin

### 2. Research Competitors

Check what others charge in your area:
- What's the average rate?
- What's included at each price point?
- Where does your facility fit?

### 3. Position Your Value

Don't just compete on price. Highlight what makes you different:
- Staff-to-pet ratios
- Facility features
- Training and certifications
- Extras included in base rate

## Common Pricing Mistakes

**Undercharging:** The most common mistake. Covering costs isn't enough—you need profit margin.

**Ignoring occupancy:** High occupancy at low prices isn't profitable. Sometimes fewer bookings at higher rates works better.

**No deposit policy:** Deposits reduce no-shows and improve cash flow.

**Confusing pricing:** Complex structures frustrate customers. Keep it clear.

**Not raising prices:** Costs increase annually. Your prices should too.

## Deposits and Cancellations

### Deposit Policies

- Require 25-50% deposit at booking
- Non-refundable for cancellations within 7-14 days
- Applies to final bill

### Cancellation Fees

- 14+ days notice: Full refund
- 7-14 days: 50% fee
- Less than 7 days: Full charge
- No-show: Full charge, lose future booking privileges

## Software for Pricing

Modern boarding software helps manage pricing:
- Automatic seasonal rate adjustments
- Package and discount calculations
- Add-on management
- Deposit collection at booking
