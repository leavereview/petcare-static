- **Last-minute bookings:** Premium for same-week bookings

## Setting Your Prices

### 1. Calculate Your Costs

Know your true costs per boarding:

- Staff wages per occupied kennel
- Food and supplies
- Facility overhead (rent, utilities, insurance)
- Equipment depreciation
- Software and admin

### 2. Research Competitors

Check what others charge in your area:
- What's the average rate?
- What's included at each price point?
- Where does your facility fit?

### 3. Position Your Value

Don't just compete on price. Highlight what makes you different:
- Staff-to-pet ratios
- Facility features
- Training and certifications
- Extras included in base rate

## Common Pricing Mistakes

**Undercharging:** The most common mistake. Covering costs isn't enough—you need profit margin.

**Ignoring occupancy:** High occupancy at low prices isn't profitable. Sometimes fewer bookings at higher rates works better.

**No deposit policy:** Deposits reduce no-shows and improve cash flow.

**Confusing pricing:** Complex structures frustrate customers. Keep it clear.

**Not raising prices:** Costs increase annually. Your prices should too.

## Deposits and Cancellations
