One unvaccinated dog can shut down your entire facility. Disease outbreaks spread fast in boarding environments, and the legal and reputational consequences can be devastating. Here's why vaccination tracking should be your top priority.

## The Real Risks of Poor Vaccination Tracking

### Kennel Cough Outbreaks

Kennel cough (Bordetella) spreads through the air and via shared water bowls. One infected dog can expose every animal in your facility within hours. The result:

- Sick dogs requiring veterinary care
- Angry owners demanding refunds
- Potential lawsuits
- Damage to your reputation
- Possible temporary closure

### More Serious Diseases

Parvo, distemper, and canine flu are even more serious. Without proper vaccination verification, you're gambling with every dog's health—and your business's survival.

## What You Should Be Tracking

### Core Vaccinations (Required)

- **Rabies** - Legally required in most areas
- **DHPP/DAPP** - Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvo, Parainfluenza
- **Bordetella** - Kennel cough, essential for any boarding facility

### Recommended Additional Vaccines

- **Canine Influenza** - Increasingly common, highly contagious
- **Leptospirosis** - Important in some geographic areas
- **Lyme Disease** - For tick-prone regions

## Manual vs. Automated Tracking

### The Problem with Manual Systems

- Spreadsheets get outdated
- Staff forget to check dates
- Expired vaccinations slip through
- No automatic reminders to owners
- Difficult to prove compliance if audited

### How Automated Tracking Works

Modern [kennel software](/kennel-software/) handles vaccination tracking automatically:

1. **Client uploads** - Pet parents upload vaccination records through the customer portal
2. **Date extraction** - System records vaccination dates and calculates expiry
3. **Automatic blocks** - Bookings are prevented if vaccinations aren't current
4. **Owner reminders** - Automatic emails/texts when vaccinations are expiring
5. **Compliance reports** - Instant proof that every dog in your facility is current

## Setting Up Effective Vaccination Policies

### Clear Requirements

Document exactly what you require:
- Which vaccines are mandatory vs. recommended
- How far in advance vaccines must be given (most require 48-72 hours before boarding)
- What documentation you accept

### Grace Periods

Decide how to handle:
- Dogs with boosters due during their stay
- New puppies still completing their series
- Dogs with medical exemptions (require vet documentation)

### Enforcement

Be consistent. It's tempting to make exceptions for good customers, but one exception can lead to an outbreak that affects everyone.

## The Business Case for Automation

### Time Savings

Without automation, staff spend 5-10 minutes per booking verifying vaccinations. With automation, it takes zero time—the system handles it.

**Monthly calculation**:
- 200 bookings × 5 minutes = 16+ hours of staff time
- At $15/hour = $240/month in labor costs

### Risk Reduction

One disease outbreak can cost:
- Veterinary bills for affected dogs
- Refunds and compensation
- Legal fees if sued
- Lost revenue during closure
- Long-term reputation damage

Automated tracking costs a fraction of a single outbreak's expenses.

## How to Implement Vaccination Tracking

### Step 1: Choose the Right Software

Look for software that includes:
- Customer portal for vaccination uploads
- Automatic expiry date calculation
- Booking blocks for non-compliant pets
- Automated reminder emails/texts
- Easy-to-read compliance reports

### Step 2: Communicate Requirements

Update your:
- Website
- Booking confirmations
- New client welcome materials
- Physical signage at your facility

### Step 3: Train Your Staff

Ensure everyone knows:
- Which vaccines are required
- How to verify documentation
- What to do if a client arrives with expired vaccinations
- How to use the tracking system

### Step 4: Be Consistent

Apply the same rules to every client, every time. Consistency protects you legally and ensures fairness.
