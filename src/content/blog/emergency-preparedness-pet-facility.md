Emergencies test the strength of your operations, training, and communication. Whether you manage a boarding kennel or a busy urban daycare, a robust emergency plan protects dogs, staff, and your reputation.

## Why Emergency Preparedness Matters

Emergencies escalate quickly in animal-care settings: stress rises, dogs vocalise, and decision windows shrink. A written plan with role assignments and checklists reduces confusion and legal risk.

## Risk Assessment: Know Your Hazards

Start with a location-specific risk register. List hazards, likelihood, impact, and mitigation:

- **Facility hazards:** Fire, smoke, power loss, HVAC failure, water leaks/floods, chemical spills
- **Environmental hazards:** Severe weather (heat waves, storms), wildfire smoke, flooding
- **Security hazards:** Unauthorised entry, animal escape, civil disruption
- **Animal health hazards:** Infectious disease exposure, aggressive incidents, medication errors
- **Transportation hazards:** Road closures affecting pickups and evacuation routes

Update the register annually and after every incident or near-miss.

## Build Your Written Emergency Plan

Your plan should be concise, role-based, and easy to access—printed at key stations and stored digitally. Include:

- **Command structure:** Incident Lead, Animal Care Lead, Safety Officer, Comms Lead
- **Activation criteria:** When to trigger the plan (alarm, threshold temperature, flood warning)
- **Contact lists:** Staff phone tree, partner vet/ER, animal control, utilities
- **Floor plans:** Exits, fire extinguishers, shut-off valves, electrical panels, assembly points
- **Dog rosters by zone:** Kennel assignments, temperament flags, medication needs
- **Checklists by scenario:** Fire, power outage, severe weather, missing dog, medical emergency
- **Communication templates:** Parent notifications, voicemail changes, website banner text
- **Recovery steps:** Damage assessment, sanitation protocol, reopen criteria

## Emergency Supplies & Facility Hardening

Stock supplies for 72 hours of operations without deliveries:

**Animal care:**
- Extra food (labelled per dog), water, bowls
- Leashes, slip leads, muzzles for emergencies
- Crate labels/ID tags

**Medical:**
- First-aid kits, non-latex gloves, eye wash
- Digital thermometers, bandage materials
- Emergency contact forms

**Facility & safety:**
- Flashlights/headlamps, batteries, portable chargers
- Radios/whistles, tarps, duct tape
- Absorbents for spills, wet/dry vac

**Hardening:**
- Fire extinguishers (inspected)
- Smoke/CO detectors
- Surge protection, backup heat/cooling
- Secure fencing and double-gate entries

## Parent & Stakeholder Communication

Clarity calms people. Decide the channel, cadence, and content before you need it:

**Channels:** SMS for urgent alerts, email for details, phone for sensitive decisions

**Cadence:** Initial alert (within minutes), follow-up within 60 minutes, then periodic status every 2-4 hours

**Content:** What happened, what you're doing, dog status, pickup guidance, next update time

## Evacuation vs. Shelter-in-Place

### Evacuation (Fire, Gas Leak, Structural Risk)

1. Trigger alarms; Incident Lead calls emergency services
2. Animal Care Lead moves dogs from nearest exits first
3. Bring printed roster and medication bag
4. Assemble at pre-defined safe area; conduct roll call
5. Comms Lead sends status to parents

### Shelter-in-Place (Severe Weather, External Hazard)

1. Move dogs to interior rooms away from windows
2. Separate anxious or reactive dogs
3. Fill water containers; secure food and meds
4. Monitor HVAC and temperature
5. Send "all-safe but sheltering" message with timing for next update

## Medical Incidents & First Aid

Define thresholds for onsite first aid vs. immediate veterinary transport:

**First-aid scope:** Minor cuts, nail quick bleeds, heat stress response, bee stings (monitor swelling)

**Do-not-administer list:** No human pain meds; no off-label drugs without vet direction

**Transportation:** Pre-authorise emergency transport with owners; maintain a go-bag with medical records and consent forms

**Bite/incident protocol:** Separate calmly, assess both dogs, provide first aid, document with photos, notify parents

## Emergency Response Comparison

| Emergency | Immediate Action | Primary Goal | Key Tools |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Fire/Smoke | Evacuate by nearest exits; roll call | Life safety | Slip leads, crates, extinguishers |
| Power Outage/Heat | Deploy fans/backup; reduce activity | Temperature control | Thermometers, backup power |
| Water Leak/Flood | Shut off source; move dogs elevated | Prevent injury | Wet/dry vac, absorbents |
| Severe Weather | Shelter-in-place interior rooms | Debris protection | Crate covers, radios, first aid |
| Missing Dog | Lockdown; last-seen sweep; alert staff | Containment | Radios, perimeter checks |
| Medical Emergency | First aid; call vet/ER; transport | Stabilisation | First-aid kit, go-bag |

## Training, Drills & Continuous Improvement

- **Onboarding:** Every new hire completes emergency orientation
- **Quarterly drills:** Rotate scenarios and document results
- **After-action reviews:** Within 48 hours, document what worked and update SOPs
- **Vendor coordination:** Review plan annually with partner vet and building manager

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should we run emergency drills?

Quarterly is a solid baseline. Rotate scenarios and document times, gaps, and corrective actions. New hires should complete a drill within their first month.

### What belongs in our emergency go-bag?

Printed rosters, labelled slip leads, a basic first-aid kit, flashlight, phone charger, markers/tape for crate labels, and copies of owner contacts.

### How do we decide between evacuation and shelter-in-place?

Evacuate for immediate life threats (fire, gas, structural risk). Shelter for external hazards (severe weather). Pre-define criteria and train staff to act without delay.

### What should we tell parents during an incident?

State the situation, actions taken, the dog's status, whether pickup is needed, and when you'll update again. Keep messages short and consistent.

## Conclusion

Preparedness is a daily practice—part facility design, part staff training, and part clear communication. Start with a risk register, write role-based checklists, stock supplies, and drill quarterly. A practised plan protects pets and people—and earns lasting parent trust.
