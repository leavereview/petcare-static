Starting a pet boarding business is exciting—but without a written plan, it's easy to underestimate costs, overlook regulations, or miss revenue opportunities. This step-by-step guide gives you a lender-ready structure for a pet boarding business plan, with real-world assumptions you can adapt to your market.

## Why Plan? Lender & Execution Benefits

Your business plan is more than a formality—it's a decision tool. Benefits include:

- **Financing readiness:** Banks and investors want a structured plan with realistic projections and risks addressed
- **Operational clarity:** Written policies (vaccination, feeding, cleaning) reduce errors and support staff training
- **Faster launch:** A prioritised timeline keeps permits, build-out, and hiring on track
- **Risk control:** Identifying seasonal demand, competition, and health protocols in advance helps you plan contingencies

## Executive Summary

Write this last—but place it first. In one to two pages, cover:

- **Concept:** Small/medium dog boarding facility with enrichment-based play, overnight care, and optional daycare add-ons
- **Location & capacity:** Target number of kennels/suites, play groups, outdoor space
- **Market & positioning:** Premium safety standards, transparent communication, convenient online booking
- **Team:** Owner-operator plus experienced supervisor; certified staff for canine behaviour and first aid
- **Financial highlights:** Startup budget, monthly revenue at target occupancy, breakeven month, cash buffer
- **Ask:** Amount of funding requested, use of funds, and expected payback horizon

## Market Analysis & Demand Sizing

Demonstrate local demand and your path to competitive advantage.

### Define Your Service Area

- **Primary radius:** 10-20 minutes' drive from the site (commuters and families)
- **Pet ownership:** Estimate dog-owning households using census/local statistics and apply a conservative percentage likely to use boarding annually

### Competitor Scan

- List 5-10 competitors with pricing (nightly rate, add-ons), capacity, hours, and strengths/weaknesses
- Identify gaps: after-hours pickup, small-dog-only play, senior-dog suites, webcam access, training packages

### Pricing Benchmarks

- **Overnight (dogs):** commonly ranges $35-$70 per night depending on region and amenities
- **Daycare add-on:** $20-$40 per day when paired with boarding
- **Extras:** enrichment sessions, one-on-one play, baths, nail trims, departure grooms

## Licensing & Compliance Plan

Regulatory compliance is non-negotiable and reassures lenders. Include:

- **Business structure & registrations:** LLC (common for liability), local business license, tax registrations
- **Animal boarding permissions:** Zoning approval/conditional use; animal control/animal welfare permits per jurisdiction
- **Facility standards:** Ventilation, drainage, washable surfaces, isolation area, waste management, pest control
- **Health protocols:** Required vaccines (rabies, DHPP, Bordetella per vet guidance), intake screening, emergency vet partnership
- **Insurance:** General liability, property, workers' comp, animal bailee coverage
- **Record-keeping:** Admissions, vaccinations, incidents, cleaning logs—ideally managed in software for audit-readiness

## Facility & Operations Plan

Detail how you'll deliver safe, consistent care every day.

### Capacity & Layout

**Small facility:** ~12-24 kennels/suites, 1-2 play areas, reception/retail, laundry, food prep, isolation room

**Medium facility:** ~30-60 kennels/suites, 3-4 play areas by size/temperament, staff break/training room

**Key considerations:** Acoustic panels, washable walls/floors, zoned HVAC, daily deep-clean schedule

### Staffing & Training

- **Ratios:** Boarding with group play often targets 1:10-1:15 dogs per trained attendant
- **Training:** Canine body language, enrichment, safe handling, cleaning & biosecurity, first aid/CPR
- **SOPs:** Check-in/out, feeding/medication, enrichment notes, incident reporting, closing checks

### Technology Stack

- **Reservations & CRM:** Online bookings, deposits, vaccination tracking, owner portal
- **Daycare add-ons:** Attendance tracking, package credits, SMS reminders
- **Reporting:** Occupancy, revenue, customer retention dashboards

## Marketing & Sales Strategy

### Brand & Positioning

- Safety and transparency first: webcams or daily photo/report cards
- Convenience: online booking, SMS reminders, after-hours pickup windows
- Trust signals: reviews, vet partnerships, certifications

### Acquisition Channels

- **Local SEO:** Google Business Profile, service pages, FAQ schema, neighbourhood landing pages
- **Content:** Publish guides (packing lists, vaccination FAQs) to attract organic traffic
- **Partnerships:** Vets, groomers, trainers; referral discounts
- **Retention:** Multi-night discounts, daycare packages, memberships

### Sales Process

1. Lead capture (web form/chat) → automated email/SMS
2. Tour offer and transparent pricing grid
3. Trial daycare day, temperament test, and onboarding pack

## Financial Model (Startup Costs, P&L, Cash Flow)

Use conservative assumptions and show sensitivity to occupancy and rate changes.

### Estimated Startup Budget

| Category | Small Facility | Medium Facility | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Lease deposits & legal | $5,000-$12,000 | $10,000-$20,000 | First/last month, attorney, permits |
| Build-out & renovations | $20,000-$60,000 | $50,000-$140,000 | Partitions, drainage, HVAC, acoustics |
| Kennels, gates, flooring | $10,000-$25,000 | $25,000-$45,000 | Suites/kennels, fencing, mats |
| Fixtures & equipment | $4,000-$10,000 | $8,000-$18,000 | Washer/dryer, storage, POS |
| Technology & software | $500-$1,500 | $1,500-$3,000 | Booking, CRM, cameras |
| Insurance & licenses | $2,000-$5,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | General liability, bailee, permits |
| Initial marketing | $2,000-$4,000 | $5,000-$8,000 | Website, signage, launch promos |
| Working capital (3 months) | $15,000-$35,000 | $30,000-$70,000 | Payroll, rent, supplies buffer |
| **Estimated total** | **$58,500-$152,500** | **$135,000-$314,000** | Adjust for local costs |

### Revenue & Occupancy Assumptions

- **Nightly boarding rate:** $40-$60 (use your local median)
- **Small facility example:** 20 kennels × 70% average occupancy × $50/night ≈ **$21,000/month** boarding revenue
- **Medium facility example:** 50 kennels × 65% occupancy × $55/night ≈ **$53,625/month** boarding revenue
- **Add-ons:** Daycare during stay, enrichment, baths can add 10-25% to average order value

### Simplified Monthly P&L (Illustrative)

| Line Item | Small (20 kennels) | Medium (50 kennels) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Boarding revenue | $21,000 | $53,625 |
| Add-ons (15%) | $3,150 | $8,044 |
| **Total revenue** | **$24,150** | **$61,669** |
| Payroll (incl. taxes) | $9,000 | $18,500 |
| Rent & utilities | $4,500 | $8,000 |
| Insurance | $600 | $1,200 |
| Supplies & laundry | $800 | $1,600 |
| Marketing & software | $700 | $1,200 |
| Misc./repairs | $400 | $800 |
| **Estimated operating profit** | **$8,150** | **$30,369** |

*Note: Illustrative only—replace with your quotes and projections. Include a seasonality view (summer/holidays higher occupancy).*

### 12-Month Cash Flow Notes

- Plan for lower occupancy in the first 3-6 months while reviews build
- Front-load expenses (build-out, deposits) and show runway from working capital or credit line
- Show sensitivity: ±10% occupancy and ±$5 rate impact on cash

## Risk Planning

- **Demand variability:** Use daycare memberships to stabilise weekday revenue; promote stay-and-play bundles in off-peak months
- **Health outbreaks:** Strict vaccine/illness policies, sanitation SOPs, isolation room, and customer comms templates
- **Staffing:** Cross-train, offer retention bonuses, maintain a PT bench of on-call attendants
- **Competition:** Differentiate with webcams, enrichment reports, later pickup windows, or transport add-ons
- **Regulatory:** Keep digital records (vaccines, incidents, cleaning logs) for inspections
