// FAQ items
const faqItems = [
  {
    question: "What is cattery software?",
    answer: "Cattery software is a specialized management platform designed for cat boarding facilities that handles online bookings, individual enclosure assignments, cat-specific vaccination tracking (FVRCP, FeLV/FIV testing), feeding schedules, medication logs, multi-cat family management, and automated owner communications. Modern platforms save catteries 12+ hours weekly while ensuring 100% vaccination compliance through automated alerts and tracking.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Explore All Features', url: '#features' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How much does cattery software cost?",
    answer: "PetCare.Software starts at £40/month for small catteries with basic features including online booking, enclosure management, and vaccination tracking. Premium plans at £60/month include staff scheduling, advanced reporting, and multi-location support. There are no setup fees, contracts, or hidden costs. All plans include unlimited bookings and a 14-day free trial.",
    links: [
      { text: 'View Pricing Details', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can cattery software handle multi-cat families?",
    answer: "Yes. PetCare.Software excels at multi-cat family management. Group sibling cats in shared enclosures or book adjoining suites, apply family pricing discounts automatically, link records so all cats appear during check-in, coordinate feeding and medication schedules, and generate combined invoices. 35% of cattery bookings involve multiple cats from the same household.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Multi-Cat Features', url: '#multi-cat' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What vaccinations does cattery software track?",
    answer: "PetCare.Software tracks all cat-specific vaccinations including FVRCP (Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus, Panleukopenia), rabies, FeLV (Feline Leukemia Virus), and FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) testing. The system automatically alerts you when vaccines are expiring or missing before a booking, ensuring 100% compliance. Owners can upload vaccination certificates directly through the portal.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Vaccination Tracking', url: '#features' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Is cattery software different from dog boarding software?",
    answer: "Yes. While many platforms handle both species, cattery software includes cat-specific features: individual housing management (cats typically don't share spaces with strangers), species-specific vaccination requirements (FeLV/FIV vs. Bordetella/DHPP), quieter environment emphasis, litter box monitoring, and separate feeding protocols. PetCare.Software handles both cats and dogs if you run a mixed facility, with appropriate settings for each species.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Compare with Kennel Software', url: '/kennel-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can owners see updates on their cats?",
    answer: "Yes. PetCare.Software includes a client portal where owners can receive photo updates, view daily feeding logs and litter box checks, read care notes from staff, check medication administration records, and communicate directly with your team. You can send updates via email, SMS, or through the portal. Pet parents appreciate the transparency and peace of mind.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Owner Portal Features', url: '#features' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does enclosure management work?",
    answer: "The system tracks availability for each individual enclosure in real-time. Assign cats to specific cages or suites based on size, temperament, and family grouping. Visualize your facility layout with color-coded status (occupied, vacant, cleaning, maintenance). Prevent double-bookings automatically. Multi-cat families can be grouped in larger enclosures or adjoining spaces. The calendar shows exactly which enclosures are available for any date range.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Booking Features', url: '#features' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does cattery software reduce admin time?",
    answer: "Yes, significantly. Catteries using PetCare.Software save an average of 12+ hours weekly by automating bookings (no more phone tag), eliminating manual scheduling and double-entry, auto-generating invoices and receipts, sending automated reminders for pickups and payments, and digitizing care logs instead of paper sheets. Staff spend less time on paperwork and more time caring for cats.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Time-Saving Features', url: '#why-need' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can cattery software handle dietary requirements?",
    answer: "Yes. Record detailed dietary preferences and restrictions for each cat including food brand and type, portion sizes and feeding times, allergies and intolerances, special medical diets, and treats/supplements. Staff see feeding instructions on daily care logs. You can track which cats have been fed and when, preventing missed meals or double-feeding. Multi-cat families can have coordinated or individual feeding schedules.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Care Management', url: '#features' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a mobile app for cattery staff?",
    answer: "Yes. PetCare.Software includes mobile apps for iOS and Android. Staff can view daily enclosure assignments, check in/out cats with photos, record feeding and litter box changes on the go, administer and log medications with timestamps, upload photos for owners, and access cat profiles and care notes—all from their phones. The app works offline and syncs when reconnected.",

        <h2 id="why-need" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mb-6">Why You Need Purpose-Built Cattery Software</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Unlike generic scheduling tools, cattery management software understands the unique needs of feline care: individual enclosures, cat-specific vaccinations, feeding routines, medical tracking, and multi-cat family stays. Everything lives in one secure dashboard, accessible from any device.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Cats have different requirements than dogs—from vaccination protocols (FVRCP, FeLV, FIV testing) to housing needs (individual spaces vs. group play). Software built for catteries handles these nuances automatically, saving you 12+ hours weekly on administration while ensuring 100% vaccination compliance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          With 2,500+ catteries in the UK and 40% adoption rate for digital systems growing at 38% year-over-year, now is the time to modernize your facility operations.
