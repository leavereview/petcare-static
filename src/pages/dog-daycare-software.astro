  {
    question: 'What is dog daycare software?',
    answer: 'Dog daycare software is an all-in-one management platform designed specifically for dog daycare facilities. It handles online bookings, capacity management by playgroup, vaccination tracking with automatic expiry alerts, owner portal access, report cards with photos, automated reminders, and integrated billing. The best systems help facilities save 15+ hours per week while reducing phone calls by 60% and eliminating double bookings.',

      { text: 'Dog Boarding Software', url: '/dog-boarding-software/' },
      { text: 'Kennel Software', url: '/kennel-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does dog daycare software cost?',
    answer: 'Dog daycare software typically costs £30-120 per month depending on features, facility size, and booking volume. PetCare.Software offers flat monthly pricing starting from £79 with no per-booking fees, unlimited users, and includes all features. Avoid platforms with per-transaction fees that punish growth—they can cost 3-5% of every booking, adding up to thousands per year.',
    links: [
      { text: 'View Pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'What features should dog daycare software have?',
    answer: 'Essential features include: online booking with real-time availability, capacity management by playgroup or weight class, vaccination tracking with automatic expiry alerts, owner portal for self-service, digital waivers and agreements, report cards with photo sharing, automated SMS/email reminders, integrated payment processing, add-on/upsell capabilities, and mobile access for staff. Facilities running mixed services (daycare + boarding + grooming) should look for unified platforms.',
    links: [
      { text: 'Pet Grooming Software', url: '/pet-grooming-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'Is dog daycare software hard to learn?',
    answer: 'No. Modern dog daycare software is built for speed at the front desk. Most teams learn core functions (check-in/out, booking, report cards) in a single shift. PetCare.Software includes unlimited training, video tutorials, and live support during onboarding. The interface is designed for busy staff who need to process dogs quickly during peak hours. Most facilities are fully operational within 2-3 days.',
    links: [
      { text: 'Start Free Trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'Can owners book and pay online?',
    answer: 'Yes. Modern dog daycare software includes an owner portal where pet parents can book available slots 24/7, pay deposits or full amounts, upload vaccination records, sign digital waivers, update pet information, view account balances, and access report cards. This reduces phone calls by 60% and allows bookings outside business hours. PetCare.Software integrates with Stripe for secure payment processing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does vaccination tracking work?',
    answer: 'Dog daycare software tracks vaccination records with expiry dates and sends automatic reminders to owners 30-60 days before vaccines expire. The system can block new bookings for non-compliant pets until records are updated. Owners upload vaccine certificates directly to their portal. This ensures 100% compliance, eliminates manual spreadsheet tracking, and protects your facility from liability.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will dog daycare software increase revenue?',
    answer: 'Typically yes. Dog daycare software increases revenue in several ways: (1) Reduces no-shows by 40-60% with automated reminders and deposits, (2) Enables upselling of add-ons like nail trims, enrichment, or grooming during booking, (3) Increases utilization by filling last-minute openings with online booking, (4) Improves customer retention with report cards and better communication. Most facilities report 15-25% revenue growth within 6 months.',
    links: [
      { text: 'Success Stories', url: '/about/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s the difference between dog daycare and boarding software?',
    answer: 'Dog daycare software focuses on daily drop-off/pickup, playgroup management, and same-day services. Boarding software emphasizes multi-day stays, room assignments, and overnight care tracking. However, many facilities offer both services and need a unified platform. PetCare.Software handles daycare, boarding, kennels, catteries, and grooming from one system, so you\'re not juggling multiple tools.',
    links: [
      { text: 'Dog Boarding Software', url: '/dog-boarding-software/' },
      { text: 'Cattery Software', url: '/cattery-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use dog daycare software for multiple locations?',
    answer: 'Yes. Multi-location dog daycare software lets you manage several facilities from one dashboard. Features include centralized reporting across locations, shared customer database, location-specific pricing and capacity rules, consolidated billing, and cross-location bookings. PetCare.Software supports unlimited locations on business plans, perfect for growing daycare chains or franchise operations.',
