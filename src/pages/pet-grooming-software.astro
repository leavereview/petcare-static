// Enhanced FAQ data

  {
    question: "What is pet grooming software?",
    answer: "Pet grooming software is a specialized management platform designed for grooming salons and mobile groomers. It handles appointment scheduling, online booking, automated reminders, detailed pet profiles with grooming history, point of sale, payment processing, and business reporting. Modern platforms save salons 15+ hours weekly while reducing no-shows by 70% through automated reminders and deposit collection."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does pet grooming software cost?",
    answer: "PetCare.Software starts at £40/month for the Basic Plan with unlimited appointments and all core features. Most grooming software ranges from £40-£120/month depending on salon size and features. Avoid platforms charging per-appointment fees (3-5% per booking) as these can cost thousands annually. With 15+ hours saved weekly, ROI is typically positive within the first month.",
    links: [
      { text: 'View Pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Is pet grooming software hard to learn?",
    answer: "No. Modern grooming software like PetCare.Software is designed for busy salons with intuitive interfaces. Most teams learn the basics (creating bookings, checking schedules, processing payments) within a day. Advanced features like custom service pricing or route optimization can be learned gradually. The time savings quickly outweigh the learning curve, with most salons fully operational within their first week."
  },
  {
    question: "Can clients book grooming appointments online?",
    answer: "Yes. Good grooming software includes an online booking portal where clients can view real-time availability, select their preferred groomer, choose services (bath, full groom, nail trim, etc.), see pricing by breed size, and book 24/7 without calling. Clients receive instant confirmation and automated reminders before their appointment."
  },
  {
    question: "Will grooming software reduce no-shows?",
    answer: "Yes. Grooming salons using automated SMS and email reminders typically reduce no-shows by 70%. Advanced features like deposit collection (capturing £10-20 at booking time), prepayment options, and easy rescheduling further protect revenue. Some salons also implement cancellation fees for late cancellations, automatically managed by the software.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Dog Boarding Software', url: '/dog-boarding-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does it track pet grooming history?",
    answer: "Yes. Pet grooming software stores complete grooming history including dates, services performed, groomer notes, clip styles, blade numbers, coat condition, temperament, and before/after photos. Every groomer sees the full history before each appointment, ensuring consistent results. Owners can also view their pet's grooming history through the owner portal."
  },
  {
    question: "Can it handle different pricing by breed?",
    answer: "Yes. Configure services with different pricing based on breed size (small, medium, large, giant), coat type (short, long, curly, double-coat), and service complexity. For example, a Labrador full groom might be £45 while a Standard Poodle is £75. The system shows correct pricing during online booking and automatically applies the right price at checkout."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there software for mobile groomers?",
    answer: "Yes. PetCare.Software includes mobile grooming features: route optimization (group appointments by area), automatic travel time buffers between appointments, service area management (only accept bookings within your coverage zone), mobile-first interface (full functionality from phone/tablet), offline mode for areas without signal, and GPS directions to appointments.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Kennel Software', url: '/kennel-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does it integrate with payment processing?",
    answer: "Yes. Grooming software integrates with payment processors like Stripe for card payments. Process transactions, issue refunds, manage deposits, track retail product sales, apply discounts, and handle gift cards—all from one system. Integrated payments eliminate double-entry and automatically reconcile your accounts."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I manage multiple groomers?",
    answer: "Yes. Manage multiple groomers with individual calendars, availability schedules, service specializations, and performance tracking. Clients can select their preferred groomer during online booking. The system balances workload, prevents overbooking, tracks individual revenue and appointment counts, and manages staff holidays and days off.",

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>Pet grooming software</strong> is a comprehensive management system designed specifically for grooming salons and mobile pet groomers. It handles everything from appointment scheduling and client management to point of sale and business analytics—replacing paper diaries, spreadsheets, and manual reminder calls.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The best grooming software includes online booking portals, automated reminders, detailed pet profiles (coat type, temperament, special needs), grooming history, and integrated payment processing. At PetCare.Software, we also support mixed facilities—so if you offer <a href="/dog-daycare-software/" class="text-brand-red hover:underline">daycare</a>, <a href="/dog-boarding-software/" class="text-brand-red hover:underline">boarding</a>, or other services alongside grooming, everything stays in one system.
