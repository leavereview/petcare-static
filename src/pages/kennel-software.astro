  {
    question: "What is kennel software?",
    answer: "Kennel software is a comprehensive management platform for pet boarding facilities that handles online bookings, room assignments, vaccination tracking, feeding schedules, medication logs, staff scheduling, automated billing, and owner communication. Modern platforms save facilities 15+ hours weekly while improving vaccine compliance to 100% and increasing revenue by an average of 23% in the first year."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does kennel software cost?",
    answer: "PetCare.Software starts at £40/month for the Basic Plan and £60/month for Premium (with multi-location support and advanced features). Most kennel software ranges from £40-£150/month depending on facility size and features. With 15+ hours saved weekly, the ROI is typically positive within the first month."
  },
  {
    question: "Is kennel software worth it for small facilities?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Even small kennels with 10-20 spaces report saving 15+ hours per week on administration. Beyond time savings, facilities see a 23% average revenue increase through online booking availability, automated upsells, and reduced no-shows. The software typically pays for itself many times over.",
    links: [
      { text: 'View Pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can kennel software handle both dogs and cats?",
    answer: "Yes. PetCare.Software manages dogs, cats, rabbits, and other small pets from one platform. You can set species-specific requirements (like separate cat and dog areas), different vaccination protocols, and specialized care instructions. All pets share the same client records for multi-pet families.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Cattery Software', url: '/cattery-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does vaccination tracking work?",
    answer: "The system stores vaccination records with expiry dates for each pet. It automatically alerts owners before vaccines expire and can block bookings for pets with expired vaccinations. Owners can upload vaccination certificates directly through their portal, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring 100% compliance."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I manage room assignments automatically?",
    answer: "Yes. The system shows real-time room availability and can assign kennels automatically based on pet size, species, and your facility rules. You can also manually override assignments, block specific rooms for maintenance, and designate special areas (quiet zones, premium suites, cat-only sections)."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it handle feeding schedules and medications?",
    answer: "Yes. Create custom feeding schedules per pet (including special diets, portion sizes, and timing). Staff receive daily task lists showing what each pet needs and when. Medication logs include timestamps, staff signatures, and dose tracking. Everything is digital and auditable."
  },
  {
    question: "How does staff scheduling work?",
    answer: "The system creates daily task lists showing all feeding, medication, and exercise schedules. You can assign staff to shifts, track who completed each task, and monitor workload distribution. Staff access everything via mobile apps, eliminating paper forms and improving accountability."
  },
  {
    question: "Will kennel software increase my revenue?",
    answer: "Yes. Facilities using PetCare.Software see an average 23% revenue increase in year one through: 24/7 online booking (capture bookings while you sleep), automated upsells (add-on services during booking), deposit collection (reduce no-shows by 45%), and higher occupancy through better capacity management.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Dog Boarding Software', url: '/dog-boarding-software/' },
      { text: 'Dog Daycare Software', url: '/dog-daycare-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How long does setup take?",
    answer: "Most facilities are fully operational within a day. The process involves: importing existing client/pet data (or manual entry), configuring your room layout and services, setting your pricing and policies, and inviting clients to the owner portal. Our support team guides you through every step during your 14-day free trial."

        <h2 id="what-is" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mb-6">What Is Kennel Software?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>Kennel software</strong> is a digital management platform designed specifically for pet boarding facilities. It handles bookings, room assignments, vaccination tracking, feeding schedules, payment processing, staff scheduling, and customer communication—all from one dashboard.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          PetCare.Software was built specifically for small-to-medium boarding facilities. It handles online bookings, vaccination tracking, staff scheduling, payments, and customer communication in one easy-to-use platform.
        </p>

        <h2 id="problem" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">The Hidden Cost of Running Without Proper Software</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          You started your kennel because you love animals, not paperwork. But somewhere along the way, admin took over. Phone constantly ringing. Sticky notes everywhere. That sinking feeling when you realize you double-booked a suite.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-brand-red p-4 my-6">
          <p class="font-bold text-brand-navy">The time trap</p>
          <p>Without software, kennel owners report spending 15-20 hours per week on admin tasks that could be automated. That's time you could spend with the animals—or growing your business.</p>
