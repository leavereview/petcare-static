  {
    question: 'What is dog boarding software?',
    answer: 'Dog boarding software is a specialized management platform designed for pet boarding facilities and kennels. It handles multi-night stay bookings, room assignments, vaccination tracking, feeding schedules, medication administration logs, automated payment processing, and owner communication with photo updates. Modern systems help facilities save 12+ hours per week while reducing no-shows by 45% through automated deposits and reminders.',

      { text: 'Kennel Software', url: '/kennel-software/' },
      { text: 'Dog Daycare Software', url: '/dog-daycare-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does dog boarding software cost?',
    answer: 'Dog boarding software typically costs £40-120 per month depending on features, facility size, and booking volume. PetCare.Software offers flat monthly pricing starting from £40 with no per-booking fees, unlimited bookings, and includes all features. Avoid platforms with per-transaction fees (3-5% per booking) that punish growth and can cost thousands annually.',
    links: [
      { text: 'View Pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'What features should dog boarding software have?',
    answer: 'Essential features include: multi-night booking management, room/suite assignment system, vaccination tracking with automatic expiry alerts, feeding schedule management, medication administration logs, owner portal with booking access, photo update sharing, automated reminders, deposit collection, peak season pricing, waitlist management, and integrated payment processing. Facilities running mixed services (boarding + daycare + grooming) should look for unified platforms.',
    links: [
      { text: 'Pet Grooming Software', url: '/pet-grooming-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'Can it handle both boarding and daycare?',
    answer: 'Yes. Modern boarding software like PetCare.Software manages boarding, daycare, and cattery services from one unified platform with shared client records. You can book the same dog for daycare on weekdays and boarding on weekends without duplicate data entry. This eliminates the need for multiple systems and ensures consistent customer experience.',
    links: [
      { text: 'Dog Daycare Software', url: '/dog-daycare-software/' },
      { text: 'Cattery Software', url: '/cattery-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: 'How does room assignment work?',
    answer: 'Dog boarding software tracks room availability, suite types, and size requirements automatically. You can assign specific rooms/kennels to bookings, set room capacities, block rooms for maintenance, and manage different room types (standard, deluxe, suite). The system prevents double-booking and shows real-time availability by room type. You can also accommodate special requests like adjacent rooms for multiple dogs from same family.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do owners get updates during their pet\'s stay?',
    answer: 'Yes. Modern boarding software enables you to send photo updates, feeding logs, medication administration records, and daily activity reports directly to pet parents through the owner portal or via SMS/email. Owners can log in anytime to see their pet\'s status, upcoming meals, and photos. This reduces phone calls by 60% and improves customer satisfaction significantly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What about peak season management?',
    answer: 'Dog boarding software handles peak seasons (holidays, summer) with built-in waitlist management, early booking discounts, seasonal pricing adjustments, capacity alerts, and priority booking for regular clients. You can set higher rates for Christmas, Easter, and school holidays automatically. Waitlist functionality captures demand when fully booked and automatically notifies clients of cancellations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does feeding schedule management work?',
    answer: 'Boarding software tracks each dog\'s feeding times, portion sizes, dietary restrictions, and special food requirements. Staff can mark meals as completed via mobile app, add feeding notes, and record any issues. Owners can see feeding logs in their portal. The system sends reminders to staff for upcoming meals and alerts for missed feedings. You can also track special diets, allergies, and medication with meals.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I collect deposits for boarding?',
    answer: 'Yes. Dog boarding software enables automatic deposit collection at booking time (typically 20-50% of total). Deposits reduce no-shows by 45% and protect revenue during peak seasons. PetCare.Software integrates with Stripe for secure payment processing. You can set deposit amounts by booking value, refund policies, and automatically charge remaining balance at check-in or after stay.',

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Dog boarding software</strong> is a specialized digital management platform designed specifically for pet boarding facilities, kennels, and overnight care providers. Unlike generic booking systems, it includes industry-specific features like multi-night stay management, room assignments, and feeding schedules.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The best platforms handle reservations spanning multiple nights, room/suite assignments by size and type, vaccination records with automatic expiry alerts, detailed feeding schedules with meal tracking, medication administration logs, photo updates to owners, automated payment processing including deposits, and comprehensive owner communication tools.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          At PetCare.Software, we built tools specifically for mixed facilities—so if you also run <a href="/dog-daycare-software/" class="text-brand-red hover:underline">dog daycare</a>, a <a href="/kennel-software/" class="text-brand-red hover:underline">kennel</a>, or even a <a href="/cattery-software/" class="text-brand-red hover:underline">cattery</a>, you can manage everything from one login without duplicate data entry.
